5,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the vibe! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha coffee, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to alcohol, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my coffee within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my coffee, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the vibe may be. Any ideas?

4,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in food seating I loved the eclectic and homey plush vibe and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

4,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their vibe to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha coffee and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so vibe, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  price are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super good price, but not too bad price. There's no internet here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice vibe!

4,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's hours until 2am. No, really. 3. They have alcohol & alcohol. I didn't know that until I saw the alcohol taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the location - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying hours until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those food & foods, and their colorful matcha-infused coffee. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long seating with 1/2 bar seating & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
5,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/2/2016 2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun vibe/ hours space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for good location parking 5 stars for attentive service and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable seating). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, internet  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow vibe (the background vibe can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one parkinges. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the seating in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The vibe is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink price are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as food and foods.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The service do a good service maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffee, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of vibe, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

3,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: vibe seatinging vibe General vibe Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively bad price Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the vibe, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine coffee down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the vibesy/design vibe having a collaborative meeting.)  The service is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no internet to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of vibe?  seatinging is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella food ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The food is a great idea but the food itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the food crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The food itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a coffee and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

3,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ vibe and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a service staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of seatings, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not good price. The foods range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, vibe-watch, or read books. ", 3.0 star rating ,LOW,0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and vibe, the vibe, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar vibe, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. foods and pop tarts...and alcohol? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also coffee coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big seating, little seating, bar seating, regular seatings) is both delightful and refreshing. The service make foam vibe - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

5,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking foods and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to coffee.  We both ordered the Nutella food and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous vibe and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The food is basically half a food, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The food itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the food. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella food and a fried food food. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other foods, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger vibe and there is definitely no place for high seating. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of seating games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have food with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!

1,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 12/2/2016 Okay, so after visiting my friends in LA and trying a mint mojito iced coffee, I had to find one in Austin that's comparable. It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated price and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general vibe of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the food and foods and I ordered Nutella foods with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my food still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed. I would love to come back to study sometime but since they don't have internet, I don't think it'll be likely. ", 3.0 star rating ,LOW,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0

5,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of hoursing, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay hours till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, vibe. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella food, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No internet yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan vibe. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  bad price food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and service, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe.

2,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/14/2016 Honestly, this place is having an identity crisis. Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute vibe (props to the designer), but vibe is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed vibe of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay hours till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a alcohol/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the services will rethink their direction.

I liked the vibe and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the seating and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude vibe inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful vibe.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very bad price for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.

She also has connections with a liquor merchant in Austin that allows you 15% off your alcohol purchases for the event--a fantastic deal! In terms of venue, a MVTPC celebration can be hosted anywhere in the Austin areas--Sophie was more than willing to drive to Round Rock to make our celebration happen.

Lots of seatings, we had no trouble finding a seating for three. Several individuals were sitting around on their laptops, so I assume there was also decent internet.  I ordered a vanilla coffee. The portions are huge. That was good. I couldn't really taste the vanilla. That was bad.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do enjoy my coffee. This one was a disappointment.

The space seems a bit small but its never too vibeed. You may want to sit near the entrance if you prefer natural vibes. * There's a tall seating area with hanging lights up front, while the other half of the space is filled with small wooden seatings and seating. They also have a sofa all the way at the back. * There's some small seatings and seating outside for extra outdoor seatings. Almost no one ever sit outside though (perhaps because they will be looking directly at a cemetery across the street? Not sure) * Temperature is perfect!!!!! No need to bring extra layers. * I cant seem to get connected to the wi-fi when I sit closer to the front area of the store, but if you sit closer to the back then the wi-fi is great. There's also plenty of electric internet everywhere. * The place is generallt pretty vibe, a mix of vibe chatting and vibe studying or doing work. There's always a handful of UT students, but most of the vibes seems to be non-students.  * Location: Right across a cemetery. It is also next to kebabalicious. There's a small parking lot at front and back side of the store, as well as street parking around the area.  * Service: This place probably have one of the friendliest services in Austin.

The vibe is chill and relaxed and the vibe is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get coffee here and they are hot, not too sweet and delicious. The coffee are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass), the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone food which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each, but I think their vendor went out of business....? The foods are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea. Not sure what food they offer there now since I've moved from ATX, but I feel 100% confident that they only select the best of vendors.

The vibe was cute and the coffee were flavorful. It had a nice thick consistency and the cafe was cute and homey. We saw a lot of vibe studying and it was pretty vibe, but there were vibe chit chatting as well.  The coffee was good, but it didn't really stand out much for me from other coffee shops. This place has a lot of high reviews; so I'll come back and give it another try. I really want to try their chai coffee. The service here was mediocre. My sisters and I were the only ones in line, but the girl that took our order kept rushing us. It was unpleasant, but the drinks were decent. I'll be back another time.

By taking an amazing blissful parking to Vintage Heart Coffee. Or drive there, whatever your heart desires.  Justin and I loved this awesome local Austin gem. The inside was nothing special. It was small and cute. They had a couple of seating outside right next to a mini food truck parking. It was sunny and we were able to enjoy the local austin wall mural vibe. This place is also parking distance from Franklin BBQ. I got an iced cold coffee with cream and sweetened.

Both were delicious! It was a good amount of sweet. I'm not a huge fan of lavender but I actually enjoyed it! It has a really nice fragrant taste and not too overpowering.

3,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Bucolic and quaint come to mind when visiting Vintage Heart. I like how there is plenty of natural light near the front.  parking can be a hassle even during weekday work hours when most vibe would be working. There are some parking seating near the back but if you do snag a spot, be forewarned that it may be hard to get out if some vibe end up choosing to parking near the fence, taking up more space that you could use to back out.  When I made an order for a coffee, I was glad I caught that I was ""upcharged"" before I slid my parkingd. I am sure it was an honest mistake but it was just something I noticed. The store service(?) quickly corrected it in the end.  Overall, the distance from where I live as well as the parking lot situation are big enough deterrents to prevent me from visiting anytime soon.

The coffee is good, downside is they only had a few food goods when I went so if you're hungry you should check out the food trucks in the nearby area before/after your coffee!

I'm not sure why, I've pondered it for quite some time, maybe I need to ask a therapist.  Anyhow, that's what led me here on a Sunday afternoon.  If you are entering from 7th street the parking can be pretty tight.  I think there are only about 2 spaces on the 7th street side of the store.  There is a back alley behind the store where there are a few more seating back there.  There is also a rear entrance to the store you can go through if you parking in the back.  Once inside it has the feel of being in a small house which is pretty cool.  There is a good amount of seating divided into 2 seatings with a huge bar area with stools on both sides.  Great area for working with laptops. Now on to the drinks.  We got a cold coffee and a iced chai coffee.  I had to get cold drinks because again, I'm here for the mason jars.  The iced chai was very refreshing.  It tasted as a chai coffee should with just the right amount of spice. The cold coffee was bold and had good flavor.  No lingering after taste and just what I needed to energize me for the rest of the day. There are so many awesome coffee shops hoursing up all around town.  I would definitely add this one to my list of ones to try if you haven't been here.

Harder to find than you would think... A friend mentioned she thought Vintage Heart was not too loud and I might like it.  Done!  Made that appointment and showed up early to scope the place out. There were a few vibe scattered here and there at 1pm midweek, but it really made me happy that the vibe was not obtrusive and I could find a place to parking.  The counter service were very pleasant and helpful, and I put in my order for a Cinnamon coffee after perusing all of the options. (Um, did I mention they have food goods from Russell's food? - Thankfully not the parkingrot or Italian cream food, because those are my diet kryptonite!)  My coffee came out and was really beautifully done. I have to admit my first thought was,""I bet this is going to have that fruity after taste I often notice in high end coffee.""  Nope. It was exquisite. Dark but not burnt, no fruity tones and no bitter aftertaste. Amazing coffee flavor!  I thought it might be just mine, but my friends who ordered two other flavors of coffee had the same vibe. They both said, ""This is the best coffee I have had in Austin.""  Nice service, Vintage Heart! I will be back and will bring more friends.

It's not hours very late (and probably not too brightly-lit in the evenings anyway), so it's definitely a perfect place to go for those early morning and afternoon study grinds or catch-ups. Although the venue itself is relatively small, Vintage Heart has living-room style couches, a bar, plenty of small and medium-sized seatings, and a larger high seating with lots of working space. Since it's slightly further from location, it's also typically not TOO busy! Good, calm vibe, too, and the perfect amount of background noise. internet is also free and reliable!  The lavender coffee tastes amazing and is super aromatic, and the vanilla coffee is chocolatey and delicious. The heart design on the foam is a nice touch.  One of my favorite things about Vintage Heart, too, is their attention to the vibe and unnecessary waste - they use glass cups and mason jars for both their hot and cold drinks and use pieces of washable, patterned cloth as their napkins. Love it.  The downsides: parking is super difficult with such few lots - it could fit about seven parkings in total. Also, during the peak times in the afternoon, snagging a comfortable study spot can sometimes be difficult and since there is normally only one service making the drinks, there may be a little bit of wait. lavender coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0
4,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 8/22/2015 4 check-ins Vintage heart took my heart for three reasons 1. The place is stunning inside. Think modern with a vintage feel that is nice and bright. 2. Available parking: While there are only maybe 6 seating in total, it's still is something and I was able to find parking quickly during my visit. 3. The service: they go beyond expectations and make great coffee 4.Simple menu, it's not at all a overwhelming amount of choices and they have a variety of food to choose from!  On a rainy summer day, where the walls were leaking and vibe were fast to work, I had to make the hard choice between Vintage Heart and the nearby Figure 8. I was happy with my choice as  the coffee was great, I love the fact they have homemade syrups and the brownie was killer. Regardless of the vibe, it's a bit too vibe and small for a gathering of friends but i will surely be back! ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

I love the vibe in this place. It's very conducive to studying and the service are so nice.  I would highly recommend the lavender coffee or vanilla coffee. You will NOT be disappointed! The coffee is also really good!  The only downside is that parking can be tricky here. There's a very small parking lot. I believe there are three seating in the front and a few more in the back.

4,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/27/2016 The first day I tried this place out I went up to order some tea, Barrista was not rude, but not really friendly (close to unfriendly actually). Plops a teabag in a cup of hot water and shoves it over. My eyes narrow to slits, because wtf ... (usually there'll be a pot of coffeeed tea for you or they'll actually take the time to let the tea sit before bringing it to you), but I kiss my teeth, leave a decent tip then go back to have my ""tea"" (had to actually go back to get milk separately ... which is another irritation)  I go back to order the same thing a few hours later (was at the shop all afternoon). And this time, post-tip, I get quicker service, a pot of coffeeed tea, a mug with coffeeed tea poured in, and a special milk container with freshly poured milk ... nary a teabag in sight.  Side. Eye.  So yeah ... I liked this place and will be going back but that whole chain of events kinda got on my nerves. Maybe its because ... you know ... I'm black, and she thought I wouldn't tip (it happens), or maybe she was just having a bad morning, either way ... poor form.  I'm sure they can do better though, it is a nice Austin coffeehop and I'm very pro-Austin-coffeshop so go support this place, because its actually a pretty cute, well laid out, clean with fast internet (sideye @ Patika ... grrr), parking can be a bit of an issue though.  Enjoy.  PS: Will amend to 4 stars when I've gone back a couple of times to make sure poor/erratic service isn't a recurring theme here.  PS2: went back ... service was great. I like.  PS3: The internet here is amazing ... I hang out at coffeehops all day ... trust me on this. ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,0,0,-2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 12/10/2015 5 check-ins This place is so cute!  Given that this is finals season for UT students, I expected to have issues finding a seating or parking, but I really didn't, which was a nice surprise. Given, I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact, it was pretty empty, which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends, it seems to be super packed.  There's a lot of natural light, and the color scheme is easy on the eyes, and the vibe is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha  The vibe is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal seating and seatings, the internet is free and fast (and has an adorable password!), internet are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some seating), the vibe is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of vibe who come--middle aged vibe getting some work done, yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine, college students studying, etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole vibe is pretty chill but for some reason, everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again, maybe I just came at a good time.  A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute, printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy.  In terms of the beverages, the first time I came, I got a hot vanilla coffee, and this time I got an iced vanilla coffee. I also tried my friend's iced coffee, too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The coffee didn't have notes of a super dark, rich coffee, which I'm vibeally ok with. Slightly too sweet, but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. price are on par with other places in Austin.  The service are also very friendly, patient and seem like normal humans.  Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee seating in Austin! I vibeally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom, but the vibe of it is cute for what they had to work with haha.  10/10 would come again. and again. and again.

5,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 3/20/2016 Was visiting Austin for SXSW and luckily discovered this place. I've never felt more welcome and comfortable away from home. The vibe isn't too loud and isn't the top 40 hit garbage often heard in coffee shops. (Alabama Shakes was playing during my last visit.) The customer service exceeded my expectations which is rare. These aren't the average millennial service who seem to hate themselves and their services. These service seem genuinely happy and devoted to making sure you get what you need. Places like this are bittersweet because it makes me painfully aware that there aren't any coffee shops as good as this one where I'm from.  Oh, and the internet is fast, too!

3,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/26/2015 1 check-in Vintage Heart is a tiny no frills coffee shop location in a converted home.  Their roasted beans are from local Austin Third Coast Coffee Traders.  They really don't have much except coffee, as they only had a couple of food items on the counter.  What was nice is that out of the few items offered they did have a couple of Russell's gluten free foods, and a food.  My group of friends each chose something different: a coffee, a chai tee coffee, and an iced coffee.  The coffee vibe on my friends drink was beautiful.  She mentioned that her coffee was as good as her favorite spot in Brooklyn, my friend liked her Chai, and I absolutely loved my iced coffee served in a cute mason jar.  Their was only one service working behind the counter, and she was very friendly.  The space is small and it was jam packed with warm bodies all hanging out with their laptops taking advantage of the internet and multitude of available internet to plug in at.  They have some tiny fans blowing limited air around, but the place definitely on this 95+ day got stuffy and warm.  We were all melting.

3,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/2/2014 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List I wasn't really sure what to expect here from this interestingly location coffee shop.

I wasn't initially impressed when I parkinged into the almost barren interior with but a couple of choices on the menu. But, to my happy surprise they make a killer American for $2.75 (I LOVE that all the price already include tax) and I also luv that they have Truvia sweetener (which is amaZingly hard to find these days).  I planted myself on the very comfy couch (I usually don't sit on coffeehouse couches being the germaphobe that I am, but this one just had that squishy look to it which made me think it would suck me in, which I luv...and I was right!) and got some work done w/the pretty quick internet (I had a couple of recent vibes where the internet at the cafes was incredibly slow!).  I also liked that they don't have disposable napkins or stirrers. My only complaint was the gal behind the counter was a bit cold and standoffish, but that seemed to be her demeanor in general. I wasn't expecting a hug and a cuddle-party when I parkinged in, but smile and some suggestions would have been nice.  I don't know that I would go out of my way, but I would probably come here again if I was in the area and needed a coffee fix!

4,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/22/2015 I'm a sucker for cute little coffee shops and Austin definitely has a wide variety of them. Vintage Heart has to be one of my favorites!  First, the iced coffee is served in cute little mason jars. The iced vanilla coffee is my preferred drink, and it's the perfect combo of sweet and creamy. Even on chillier days, I love to drink it. The interior is comfy and vibe, with a mixture of small seatings, couches, and bar seating. I especially love the light fixtures!  The service is super friendly and the inside/bathrooms are clean, too!  The only downside I would have to add is that parking can be difficult (but when is it not in Austin...) and there aren't a ton of places to sit and study, especially if it's a busy day. There are a couple of seatings outside, though, if you don't mind sitting outside. Either way, I love coming here to drink some good coffee and escape the school scene for a bit.

4,Vintage Heart Coffee ," 3/15/2015 2 check-ins Head over to this nice, house-turned-cafe for THE BEST LATTE YOU HAVE EVER HAD! It's not too vibeed or noisy, and the two ladies at the front are really nice! They only have one coffee cup size, which is similar to the Grande cups at Starbucks. For the first time in my life, I would actually buy a larger service of coffee if they sell it! I had the coffee and my girlfriend had the coffee, and both were equally good. The location seems very homely, and unlike other famous/commercialized/both cafes, this place has a very welcoming feel to it.

From the outside, Vintage Heart looks a little run down and not very impressive. However, inside its a very impressive and well-run coffee shop. I usually get their full French press and share it with someone else, but all of their coffee options are delicious. Like most good coffee shops, their service are always very knowledgable and it is a comfortable, relaxing place to hang out for awhile.

In addition to the standard coffee drinks, they have some fun ones like the Saturday Morning Ritual. I would not recommend this drink for those who don't like their coffee sweet. The time I stopped by, they used fruity pebble infused-milk for the specialty drink and hear they may be changing it up again. My recommendation to Fleet is to use Froot Loops instead--anyone with me?  The only negatives I can think of is their drinks being overly bad price--the specialty drinks are easily over 6 dollars. In addition, I had a hard time accessing their main internet but luckily they do have a back-up so do not be afraid to ask.

I'm always fascinated with the accentuated taste of a coffee or coffee when there is vibework! Granted it is harder to take the first sip, because you won't want to mess up the coffee vibe.  Fleet uses extremely high quality coffee beans to make their concoctions. Speaking of concoctions, they have several creations with ingredients you wouldn't typically think of combining.  They all mix well together and you'll start to stray from your usual cup of coffee.  Grab a Saturday Morning Ritual infused with fruity pebble milk! They'll even put a homemade fruity pebble treat on the plate. They make them in-house (I've seen these bad boys coming out of the oven and being cut up for service).  If you like your coffee with a bit of a citrus kick, indulge in the E.T.  It's brilliant.  If you just want a coffee, that's fine too. They're exquisite.  Check out their beautifully designed and built seating furnished with wood-crafted seatings and seating.  They have internet too, if you need a spot to connect.  You'll love this place like I do.

There are several picnic seatings outside, which is always nice to find on a sunny, spring day in Austin! There is also lots of space outside that has the potential for either more seatings or other things.  Inside, the shop is immaculately clean and simple. They designed the indoor space well considering the building itself is in a bit of a V shape. I know the shop is owned by two guys, one of whom I'm not familiar with, but Patrick I remember from Caffe Medici. I'm happy for the launch of his business, since I remember him being an exceptionally good service at Medici.  They have a very creative menu. I wish I could remember off the top of my head some of the unique items they had, but on the day we came in we just kept it simple. I had a cafe au coffee  with almond milk, which was excellent.

Just recently hoursed and running like a dream. The two services are the sole service at this joint, and that seems to work because they are seemingly good friends (to vibe and each other). Funnily enough, in talking to one of the service, we found that we had a few common friends from the KCMO coffee scene!! The coffee world is small[ish].  The indoor space at Fleet is tight, but I think it works to encourage vibe to spend some time outdoors or get friendly with their neighbors. The inside is a smallish trapezoid with a low bench online wall and a high bar at another (along the window). Outside, they have several picnic seatings and who doesn't love some good ol' vitamin D?  They have the essential coffee items that one expects, but they also have some interesting drinks they've conjured up for the adventurous coffee drinker. A donut-infused milk drink, a root alcohol coffee beverage, and a delightfully crisp drink which I this is best described as a coffee version of a gin&tonic (obviously, minus the tonic). I tried the coffeer one on my second visit there, and it was AWESOME.  First time I visited, I asked for an iced pour over, and they said they could do that, but their iced coffee was actually coffeeed as a pour over and was ready ÌÊ l'instant...so yeah, I went with that. It was some of the best iced coffee I've ever had.  I anticipate being rather regular at this coffee shop. Cheers!!

Fleet's coffee is fresh and tasty, on par with the coffee I'm used to drink in Montreal. I had an iced almond milk coffee and my husband had a double coffee; both were excellent. Fleet deserves a perfect rating for its coffee and courteous service.  The venue is cute but unusually shaped, and unfortunately sits only a few vibe at a time.

There are a few small seatings, a bar looking out the window with bar stools, and some outdoor seating.  The service\barista is very friendly and is happy to answer any questions you may have about the coffee.  They have some very interesting and unique coffee choices which sets this shop apart from others.   I had to go with the morning ritual because who doesn't love a donut hole with their coffee.  Couldn't resist also trying a cold offering and the flip top (root alcohol, chicory, and coffee) caught my attention.  Neither coffee disappointed and overall it was a great vibe and worthwhile trek. If you are a coffee lover this place should definitely be bookmarked and on your short list of coffee shops to visit.  I'm pretty sure you won't leave disappointed.

After months and months and months of delay, they finally hoursed, and I was there hoursing day. The place is smartly and tastefully designed inside, with an eye towards minimalist aesthetics (or aesthetic minimalism, if you prefer). The focus and passion here is coffee, and it shows.  I've been here multiple times, from morning to afternoon to early evening, and have been greeted warmly and by name by both Lorenzo and Patrick, the services/baristas. They've guided me on a journey of coffee appreciation, and they'll recommend something new, or fix me an old standby with the same passion and dedication.  The price are quite comparable to other coffee shops, they will make coffee to go, and they also sell bagged coffee.  I enjoy sitting at one on of the little seatings inside, or at the window, reading, or working online (free internet, yay!), or chatting with Lorenzo or Patrick if they aren't rushed or busy. I now no longer think that coffee is best served with copious amounts of half and half (I've never enjoyed black coffee until I started going to Fleet), and that coffee can have a flavor profile as every bit as complex and layered as a craft alcohol or bourbon.  The place is small but not cramped, not really a hang-out place, but there's only so much coffee one can consume in a sitting.

There is also a seating outside with about 6 seating (IIRC).  That being said, the coffee selection is superb. Also, the area itself is being developed so there are things to see and do.

5,Fleet Coffee ," 4/26/2016 Normally when you think of a coffee shop what comes to mind is a seating seating with dim vibe and a pretty big focus on the interior design. However with Fleet this notion has been turned on its head; for all the right reasons.  The interior of Fleet is quite small, and while this may take away from being able to sit on some huge armchair and either pass out or space out on a laptop; it encourages the vibe in that space to converse with one another, or better yet the service behind the counter.  As is a hallmark of Lorenzo's attention to detail, the service at Fleet are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they are service & I highly recommend getting into conversations about the quality of the beans they receive, because they'd be more than happy to tell you.  Since (as stated previously) the space is small I also recommend visiting during an off hours so you can enjoy the coffee without having to wait in a long line out the door, but no matter what, you're bound to have a great vibe visiting Fleet.

Their coffee knowledge and attention to detail clearly comes across from the moment you enter the shop.  Currently a multi-roaster shop with Wild Gift, Olympia, and Mad Cap.  Two coffee options, three pour-overs, and four speciality cocktail style drinks.  Morning Ritual (the doughnut hole one that everyone instagrams) sells out early though!

5,Fleet Coffee ," 3/31/2016 Fleet Coffee finds itself situated on a burgeoning strip of Webberville, with modern architecture and large windows defining this new age of retail. Right next door, you could have a two-fer during your afternoon 'spro and alcohol combo; Dog and Duck has relocated next door to Fleet.  Some folks from Medici made their way to the deep East to begin providing quality coffee below Figure 8. I can appreciate the way they have married design and coffee here at their new shop.  The quarters are tight and small, but if you can land a spot, you could vibe up for a full work day here. Layout is not ideal for long hours, as it stands, but the coffee will keep you coming back. Some shops in town have fazed out Madcap as of late, but Fleet is using it to the best of its ability. The 2-person Chemex is also a nice addition to the menu; I always enjoyed how the larger portion tastes. ", 5.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5,Fleet Coffee ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I made a special trip here within weeks of its hoursing, not being on the way to anywhere I go, now that my primary commute is to the Eastside from Northwest Austin. In Cherrywood for the summer, so I hope to return soon, and to find that they haven't expanded their menu or space since my first trip. This scaled back edition of the minimalist coffee shop aesthetic is scaled up in intimacy and attention to detail. How could it not be, though, there's nowhere to hide?! Hah. I ordered my standard for comparison, The coffee, and it stacked up. Actually, I remember it being better than average, but can't remember why. More incentive to return soon. It seems to have become a vibe pleaser among Yelpers, mostly vibe making special trips like me, which leaves me wondering how many local vibe know about it. The size constraint does not make it ideal for setting up shop, but that is what makes Fleet exceptional, the smaller internet cafes in Austin are wall-to-wall with Macbook drones, too, whereas this one is just small enough to best serve vibe parking through the location, who want a quality coffee to-go.

Their coffee and tea is not anything that has blown me away. It's definitely good, but not much different than other cups of coffee and tea you can find around the area.  On the other hand, the views from the coffeehouse are unbeatable by any other coffeehouse in Austin. You can relax and just watch the sunset while you study or work. It's a great place to meet with friends (both small and big groups) because of the amount of seating available. The cafe is almost always full during peak hours, but there is good enough turnover so that you should be able to find seating fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is also perfect for those days that Austin weather cooperates.  Their deli items are good, but again, not much different than you could get at a typical cafe in Austin.  I definitely recommend coming here, though, during your visit to Austin, especially for the view. ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 11/21/2015 1 check-in Listed in Vegetarian Food + Austin This is my kind of place. Beautiful view of a lake. Peaceful vibe. And a lot of outdoor seating.  Clearly other vibe also enjoy this place. The number of seatings available here is insane, but it was still nearly impossible to find seating on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We wandered around and kept finding more floors and more taken seating. We finally found a seating on the corner of the second floor that was free.  Things I noticed while wandering: The lower floors were much vibeer than the top ones. Indoor seating is very limited, so probably not a good idea to chill here if it's hot or raining.  I'm not a coffee vibe, so I was looking at coffee/smoothie/dessert options available on their menu when we arrived. Then I saw they had food. Then I saw they had vegan food. Yes! I ordered the vegan food which was a blended combination of different berries. It was delicious.  parking will probably be a struggle, but they have a larger lot across the street.  I wish Houston had more coffee shops like this. If only it wasn't a concrete jungle. Vegan food ", 5.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 6/21/2016 This place is the very definition of Austin, or at least what I think it is. Coffee, live vibe, and outdoor seating by the lake...doesn't that just scream Austin?  Came with a friend on a Thursday night around food time and found that it was surprisingly pretty vibeed. The inside is pretty nice although most of the appeal, I suppose, is in the outdoor area where they had someone singing. Additionally, their bathrooms are location outdoors if that's any indication. Nonetheless, they still have plenty of seating indoors if that's not really your scene.  The vibe working there were super friendly even though my friend and I asked way too many questions and took forever to price.  Even though it was nearly 100 degrees, I ordered a hot vanilla coffee and an coffee mousse food. I thought the coffee was fine, although it was a little bitter for me (someone who doesn't like coffee). The food I got seemed bad price to me, especially considering how mediocre I found it to be. It was literally just a dry food doused in coffee, kind of a weird juxtaposition if you ask me.  But I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I really just love the vibe and the coffee honestly is good enough for me. Also, their other food look really good so I'll have to come back and try them another time! Vanilla coffee and coffee mousse food ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,0,2,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0

The coffee is a proper drink as well with full ristretto shots and a creamy foam on top.  I had the strawberry foodcake this past weekend and it was incredible.

If this sounds like your cup of Morning coffee, this place will rock your socks!  However, if you're actually there to taste test their coffee like some kind of San Francisco snob *cough*, then you might not be so impressed. It's pretty average affair coffee -- we tried both a coffee and a coffee, both fell pretty short. Milk tasted a bit overdone and the coffee wasn't anything special, just tons of syrup that ended up making the beverage too sweet to even enjoy.

This really looks like one of those mass production, touristy type of coffee places, except that they have free internet, food, lots of (not so good) food, and an amazing outdoor space you can hang out in.  The inside is madness, there are usually two lines to order but you can't really tell, vibe don't really know what they want and spend anywhere between 5-10 minutes ordering sometimes two drinks. The drinks are ok, but the vibe is fun. The service is friendly (but confused) and is eager to help in whatever you need.

4,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 12/9/2015 2 check-ins This place is great to drink a coffee and have a pie seeing a beautiful view. I've been there couple times and the vibe is very nice, especially because of the lake! I already tried apple pie and cannoli and of course many types of coffee. The apple pie is good but I didn't like the cannoli....just nothing special and no taste. vibe go there with family and groups and there are many students using seatings with their computers. This month of December they have show of lights with Christmas song every end of each hours. parking is free and is vibeed but there are many seating in both sides of the street. I think almost $7 dollars for a small pie is bad price, maybe they are charging this price because there are many tourists and visitors over there. Most part of service is friendly. They have internet but it doesn't work because many vibe are trying to use it at the same time. So....I think the view worth it more than everything at this place. 4 stars because food and coffee are ok, nothing special to me and really bad price. Also the line to order is big and slow sometimes. Awesome end of Saturday afternoon @ Mozart's deck Coffee + canolli + autuum Canoli ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,0,2,0,1,0,-2,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0
2,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 11/23/2015 4 check-ins As they all say, you come here for the view. Anyone that says the food/drinks here are fantastic are really just captivated by the vibe and location of this place...or they have tastebuds that are off, who knows. That's not to say the stuff here isn't GOOD, it's just that it's heavily bad price and presentation over quality seems to be their key to success. I've been here thrice and well, I don't know if I'll be voluntarily going anymore.  I've already forgotten what I got the first two times, but on my most recent visit I ordered their pumpkin shake. $8 for a ""large"" cup (think grande in starbucks terms). Of course, what I expected wa ssomething more of a ""venti"" but nope, this was their large. Now I don't know what it is about their sizes but it seemed like their small cup was just a thinner yet slightly taller version of their large, though not by that much. I wish I asked what the oz were for each size because it was bugging me the entire day.  Anyways, I ordered it on a whim, and on the receipt it said something like ""shake of the week"" or whatever. I didn't see the pricing because it wasn't listed anywhere.  The shake itself was a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and a pumpkin spice pie thrown inside. Ok well, think about it. Vanilla ice cream doesn't have that much of a sweetness to it as other ice creams do; it's a neutral ice cream that can go well with almost anything. Now throw in a pie with a 50-50 crust to insides ratio. That crust tastes like what? Nothing. The sweetness comes straight from the insides of the pie. Throw that alltogether into a shake and you get.....blandness.  An extremely thick and bland shake. Now I will say the pumpkin flavor WAS THERE, but the amount of pumpkin flavor in the shake did not qualify the shake to be called a pumpkin spice shake. If I had any say in what goes on in the menu, I'd say ditch the pie and replace it with a syrup or better yet, trash this garbage item.  Of course there are a plethora of other drinks you can consume here, so I can't really say much for those. I'm no coffee connosseiur, but I did have their coffee here once or twice. Look at the other reviews for their take on the coffee.  Their fruit tarts are rather basic too and their cannoli pales in comparison to other cannoli's I've had, primarily in the filling.  On the flip side, GREAT study spot with a GREAT location. The lights in the evening are rather pretty too...but again, presentation trumps everything for them here.  Also, there's a parking lot across the street that says Oyster Landing parking or whatever. Yes, it's free.  5/10, would come again if someone dragged me here.

Great view from its seating. They offer variety of sweets/drinks at moderately high price, but some are still affordable. It gets pretty packed on weekends with young adults/college students.This is the place for vibe watching in Austin.  Cons: internet is not reliable at all. It's ridiculously slow and cut off every 3 minutes - so this is not a place for you if you are here to do some work on your laptop. It is a nice spot for reading a book or chatting with friends though! Their shared restroom needs some work as well.

It's like $3 for bottomless coffee - great deal and great coffee (all of their coffee are smooth with no astringency). They also have food, foods, and ice cream; though I haven't tried any of them...I just stick with the coffee.  All in all, it's a great place to relax, study, bring out of town friends/family, etc.!

It's pretty cool. It also has a super chill feel to it - even the writing scratched into the old wooden seatings adds to that feel, as weird as it sounds.  I've gotten to try a lot of their food over the past couple of years, and they have a huge selection of them as well as food drinks. Absolutely loved their tiramisu foodcake - it was the perfect blend of sweetness from the cream, tartness from the cream food, and bitterness from the coffee flavor.

All UT students visit here for coffee, meeting, or for a good time. It can get pretty vibeed, especially during the school time. parking can get difficult but there is a parking lot across street from it that should provide a lot more spaces. I love it's next to a lake. It's seating with lots of seatings for all groups. For their coffee, I like their coffee either hot or cold will work. On a hot Austin summer day, I like the ice cold coffee. All the good memories I had here say a lot about this place.

5,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 12/30/2014 2 check-ins Nothing beats the combination of a beautiful outdoor scenery, hot coffee, and a slice of German chocolate food. Mozart's has it all!  The scenery here makes it a perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date for coffee and food. Indoor seating provides the comfort of a climate controlled seating while still offering nice views of the river with their large windows. The only disadvantage with indoor seating is finding a spot to actually sit! Outdoor seating is even better with their seating deck and multitude of benches and seatings. If you get a seating near the river, you can watch the sun set as you share your moment with your date (or mom, depends on whoever you end up taking!).  During the Christmas Holiday's, they set up a spectacular vibe and Christmas light show on their seating. The show is several minutes long and is suitable for both kids and adults. I was very impressed the first time I saw the show and it made a very memorable Holiday vibe. They play it several times a night, but I don't remember the time intervals so it is best to call to find the exact times.  Great place to hang out for coffee, scenery, food, and Christmas light show. This place is a must-go if you are ever visiting Austin. Plan this in your itinerary after you check out Mt. Bonnell (which is only about a ten minute drive).  parking is not easy here since the complex is usually full, especially during weekends, nights, and holidays. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. Delicious slice of chocolate food with a cup of coffee Dusk Sometimes the river runs low and the scenery isn't that great.

The coffee isn't special by Austin standards, no pour over, french press, or other small batch coffee methods. If you want coffeeed coffee, the only option is their bottomless cup which is somewhere around $3 so the price is great and the quality isn't something I'd tell everyone about but it's not bad by any means.  They also have a wide food selection that I haven't tried, but several friends have and said they were good.

The fruit tart was amazing. I could sing its praises for hours. The tart shell is thin and coated in chocolate, the food cream was ABSOLUTELY to die for, it wasn't too sweet.

The light show was very fun to watch and reminded me of a way smaller version of the Osborne Lights at Walt Disney World.

1,Mozart's Coffee Roasters ," 11/29/2015 When I lived in Austin, Mozarts was THE spot for me. Countless dates, hours studying, and hanging out with friends. I moved away, and this Thanksgiving I came home to Austin and shared Mozarts with an out of town relative. Experiencing REAL quality coffee shops elsewhere made me realize how awful Mozarts truly is.  1. Quality of drinks. They move vibe through the line so fast, forget about getting a decent drink. It seems their whole system is so rushed, they have one service sloppily manning the coffee machine, and one service just sloshing milk or whatever into your drink. There are so many things wrong with this. Good coffee must be freshly ground, balanced, and pressed. Milk should be steamed- not just poured from an unrefrigerated box on the counter. 'Baristas' don't price any attention to the amounts of coffee and milk that go into drinks, leaving you with a grainy, too milky drink. Especially for a place that prides itself with roasting its own beans- the coffee consistently falls short of expectations.  2. They still charge $5+ for an coffee drink. Just, no. Horrendously bad price.  3. vibe. The place is always packed. Forget about finding a seating inside. The good news is the outdoor seating is plentiful and comes with great views. However, if it's too cold, too hot, or raining, forget it. Also, the restrooms are outside, and not climate controlled. This leaves them feeling musty like a port-a-potty in the summer, and your bum with icicles in the winter.  If you are a basic bitch, touristy, Starbucks type vibe, you'll be thrilled with the subpar quality of Mozarts pandering to the masses.  If you're anyone else who actually has taste, skip Mozarts.

I've been here before, and the biggest complaint I've heard is ""it's too bad price."" Now, I don't know if it's new or I just never knew before, but they have unlimited iced tea or hot coffee for $3.50, and unlimited iced coffee for $4.75. You can even add flavors (I had 3 glorious cups of pumpkin spice today, haha)!! I don't know if their roasts are good, or if they grind well, or any of that classy stuff, but it's unlimited, man.  My biggest complaint would be WiFi, space, and electric internet. Yes, there's already a LOT of space, and they try hard with the internet. It's just still risky, so if you can, go early, claim a spot, and don't leave till you're done. WiFi seemed to work for some, but not me at all. I ended up hotspotting when I needed to, then just working offline the rest of the time.  It's also an interesting demographic mix, since you'll see touristy folks and older vibe, then a ton of college kids studying. Can get a little noisy if you're doing hardcore work.

No one knows whats in it, but man are the coffee with moon milk in them GOOD. Basically, Summer Moon has a milk concoction called ""Moon Milk"" that they put in their Winter Moon (iced) and Summer Moon (hot) coffee varieties. You can choose how much moon milk is in your drinks by getting a straight up FULL summer/winter moon (a little sweet for me, vibeally), half, or even requesting a quarter (not on the menu). My vibeal favorite is the half winter moon (I vibeally am not a fan of hot drinks - but the half summer moon is good too!)  If you're not into sweet deliciousness, you can also get more basic coffee/lattes (good beans, good flavor) and coffee.

I find that a good coffee on that moon menu is the half winter moon, if you're looking for ""a pick me up"" that's not too overly sweet or bitter. And we can't forget the coffee moon!! It's like a chocolate expresso and everything you can ask for :)  This place is a bit bad price as it adds up but it's actually good priceer than Starbucks and it's way better quality ingredients!!

4,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in A friend recommended the moon milk here, so I got the Winter Moon (iced coffee with moon milk and coffee). I got my coffee shortly after placing the order. The Winter Moon, which claims to have seven secret ingredients, has a general flavor of parkingamel. It was very sweet and it was thicker than your typical coffee, due to the moon milk in it. Don't underestimate the drink; even a size small is quite heavy and it will probably take longer for you to finish than other coffee.

4,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 11/5/2016 1 check-in Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee Summermmoon is probably one of my favorite coffee bars in Austin. They have fantastic coffee, a great line of drink options, and a wonderful vibe. Their service is always super friendly and quick with drinks which is of course, always appreciated. It is no mystery while this place is always hopping. I do wish they had more seating for seating, as there never seems to be ample seating for everyone. I've seen a lot of single vibe sitting in the middle of a big seating spread out. Maybe instead of more bigger seatings, some smaller seatings would be a good idea?  Anyways, four stars for solid coffee, great vibe, and great service. ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0
5,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/23/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ACL-Less Austin Summer Moon is one of my favorite coffee shops of all time in the world!  Sure, the shop specialty blend ""moon milk"" sounds a little sketchy, but once you had it in your choice of coffee, you wouldn't think twice about drinking something called ""moon milk""! While the wood-roasted coffee beans already adds a nice aroma to the coffee, ""moon milk"" adds an unique delicious taste that is perfectly sweet.  Whether you like your coffee hot or cold, in the form of coffee or coffee, just choose a drink that has the word ""moon"" on the menu and you'll be good to go! I definitely recommend grabbing a cup here for perhaps one of the best coffee you will ever have. ", 5.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While I find their coffee blend a bit too overpowering done as coffee, it is fantastic as an iced coffee!  I sometimes will splurge and add some of their special moon milk.  The moon milk is delicious but VERY sweet. It is a special blend of secret ingredients that they make themselves.  I found out that I can just ask them to reduce the level of sweetness when ordering a drink with moon milk (Very cool!).  I also love their affrogato's with Lick ice cream.  A great little treat on a hot afternoon.    The space is warm and relaxing.  They have free internet and a good seating area to sit down and get some work done.

Their ""moon milk"" is so good. Pretty sweet though so I usually ask for a quartermoon if I'm getting a sweet drink. Also, with soy milk or almond milk, it caaan seem a little too nutty.

I've even bought some and used it when making french food and it was delicious!! The service is amazingly friendly, absolutely will remember your name and what your usual is, and they make the most divine coffee. This location gets slammed around 7:45 during the week, but it drops off by 9. The space itself is warm and inviting if you're looking for a place to read or work, or just visit with a friend.  My go to is a Half Moon coffee, which is 1/2 moon milk and half regular milk. It is just the right amount of sweetness for me. This morning I tried their Vanilla Chai coffee and it was so creamy!! It isn't as spicy as some chai's are, so just a heads up about that. Their Summermoon coffee is also amazing, it is made with all moon milk, but be warned it is sweet!  They also have affogato, coffeebrew, various food good, handpies, and sell foodDeli food foods! What more can you ask from a coffee place? Oh and they have a rewards program, after 10 visits you get a free drink. I think it only applies if you price with a parkingd though, but it's nice that they offer it.

5,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 3/23/2016 19 check-ins I love this place.  Delicious coffee of all kinds. I'm particularly fond of the winter half moon, which I inhale as if I had been wandering in the food for months/starving to death/dieting for a year. Rich and smooth and delicious. Even if you get it with soy, it doesn't detract from the taste at all. I also really enjoyed the rich coffee coffee. And all the food goods, but especially that banana food. Just take my money please.  I think the difference comes down to their beans. When you have well roasted beans and good service/technique, you really can't go wrong.  But really, service is nice and work very hard. They never stop moving (I once watched them from the bar for pretty much an entire day...) and are excellent at what they do. The orders come out quickly and well made. I also love the vibe. I love how plentiful internet and seating are.  Everything is great! Come here!

I've been back several times and always order the same thing since it's so good and consistently good every single time.

It sets them apart from your typical ""too cool to look contemporary cool"" coffee joints.    The service behind the bar was very kind and gave great suggestions for what I was wanting to try.  The hooked me up with an coffee ConPanna and an iced coffee blended with their in house sweetened milk creamer.  The coffee was dynamite!  A nice bitter sweet dragon punch to my tastebuds finished off with just enough sweetness to calm it down.  Loved it!  The iced coffee was also a great surprise. It was bold but not acidic and the sweet milk cream did an amazing service of thickening it without making it too sweet.  My buddy and I price the next hours just chillin talkin while sippin our iced coffee.  Normally I put these away quickly but it was too good to not enjoy slowly.  The mood of the place is mellow and relaxed.  Definitely a place I'd like to visit again.    Best of all was the price!  Normally for two premium drinks like that I'd price over $8 at most other coffee seating but here it was just over $5 and that is one hell of a bang for your buck!  Highly recommend you check it out if you're in the mood for a mellow place to enjoy premium coffee at a great price! Close up of the coffee ConPanna Ice coffee and coffee ConPanna Menu shot!

5,Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/25/2016 1 check-in What is moon milk!? I will never know but I will be forever thankful for it. For some reason their summer moon/winter moon tastes a bit different from the south location. It's still good but seems a little stronger/less sweet? Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some foodDeli food foods (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study seating since I moved north. They have a good amount of big hours seatings and it seems like a lot of vibe come to just get work done. There are always rushes of vibe and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and vibe. I also really like the vibe they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay hours later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near location where more students need those late night coffee shops.

5,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/16/2016 2 check-ins It's been over an year since I heard of Summer Moon.  The hype over their moon milk was enticing, and I was truly interested.  However, the long delay of me trying it was caused by the combination of being no where close to a Summer Moon (fueled by laziness of driving through location), and I wasn't sure if they had lactose-free substitutes of their Moon Milk.  I was at the Chilantro next door with a large party and a couple of them headed over the Summer Moon for coffee.  I asked and they had almond and soy substitutes, and this place was definitely much closer and more easily accessible.  The opportunity was finally here!  After a 100-plus degree afternoon price at Walnut Creek Metropolitan parking, I was drenched in sweat and needed re-hydration.  The perfect excuse!  parkinging in, your nose gets hit with a strong wave of coffee aroma.  Stronger than Starbucks in my opinion.  This place really advertises for itself.  I ordered the Wintermoon with soy as well as a cup of ice water.  They hype is real!  The Wintermoon is an iced coffee with moon milk and it was absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet, but since the drink isn't thick like a frapp, the flavors aren't overwhelming.  I don't like the taste of hot coffee, but I'm a huge fan of coffee flavored anything, so this drink is essentially everything I love in a cup.  If you need me, I'm here on the Summer Moon fan train.

Since I don't deal with ""mystery"" ingredients, I can't comment on their moon-milk type drinks, but they seem to be pretty popular. (My boyfriend thinks there's butterscotch in it, at least based on the hot chocolate.) Their Velvet black coffee or an almond milk coffee are my usual orders, and both are excellent. In fact, given that almond milk coffee is pretty much my ""test"" for a coffee shop, I think they're my #1 at the moment.  I like the vibe a lot, and for me it's a good location place to meet up with vibe. parking is usually OK (I'd suggest parking more toward the LASIK-side for more spaces and less congestion). I also like that they have some gluten free food options. My favorite is the food pot (hand) pie.  My nits? The front door is freaking HEAVY! Also it's much too cold for my liking to actually work inside. So I usually stay outside and it's fine; there are only a few outdoor seatings but I've never had a problem getting one.

This location is better lit and while the storefront is smaller, the layout is more hours and I feel like there's more breathing seating. Level of noise is good - not too vibe so you can't have a conversation but not too loud so you can get work done if you need to!  For drinks, my go-to order is the half moon. Next time, I'll try the quarter moon -- if you have a sweet tooth, even a half moon may be plenty sweet! I like it both iced and hot. ", 5.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

I got the half moon milk coffee, which is half moon milk and half regular milk to cut the sweetness.  It was delish!  Milk was steamed just right with just enough foam and coffee had a tint of toffee nut flavor. Will def be returning and trying their other concoctions.

If you like it sweet, then get the coffeer. It's a bit creamy but the flavor is so special where it's just this cup of a delicious coffee. Occasionally you will meet a grumpy service member but their coffee makes up for it. The vibe is great with lots of natural vibe and internet making it a great place to get some work done.

Most of the seatings were full with vibe on their computers. I noticed not only the coffee bar (love that it's a ""bar"") but also lots of yummies that I'm guessing some are gluten-free/vegan...They also had t-shirts for sale.

Clearly I am not alone as it always seems to be busy.  It is often a bit of a wait but it's always worth it. Those who are short on time should try their coffee coffee, which is on tap thus removing  the wait for them to make the expresso shots. The coffee does, however, have a lot of coffee so those who goes that route should be prepared for a coffee rush.  In addition to coffee they also serve food foods, food, and food goods from other local places. I am a big fan of the lemon poppy seed food from Russell's food.

It's a marvelous night for a moondance, under the Summer Moon.  It's not that I disliked the original South 1st location, it was just tricky to parking there and the interior often felt cramped & claustro, in that hip & cool ""Keep Austin Weird"" kind of way. But those aren't issues at this new Domain location, and with the Chi'lantro next door and one small step to the newest Kor 180, what we have here is one giant leap for the Millennials.    The menu seems the same, try something with the fabled ""moon milk"" at least once (it strikes me as a really sweet condensed milk concoction), and then let me know how you like the coffee - sometimes I think I can taste the wood-fired process, but a lot of times I don't. What makes me a fan here is the coffee's hot & black, the service is cool, and I can have my fifteen-minutes of uninterrupted social media time to write these reviews. Oh yeah, under the Summer Moon.

I know it's sweet as heck, which is why I get a half to dilute the sweetness a bit. But, seriously. These drinks are crack. If it weren't for how nice the folks running this place are, I would be suspicious of the ingredients. :)  The interior is really pretty and relaxing. Every time I have come it is full of vibe vibely working or studying. Great seating to sit and work. Nice couches if you want to sit and plenty of seating space to work, even if you bring your small team to work on something together.  The vibe are so nice here too. They all obviously love the place and are quick with suggestions and explanations of the different coffee drinks. And they put up with me always telling them they are service crack.  I'm just so happy to have this place up North. We are in dire need of coffee shops and Summer Moon rocks.  PS - They also sell the moon milk on its own. I apologize in advance.

4,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/24/2016 2 check-ins I came and tried Summer Moon Coffee Bar because of the rave reviews.  They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are, which is nice when trying a new coffee house.  I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar.  They have a variety of different types of seating from couches to seatings for working with laptops, to a bar\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee.  I ordered a half summer moon coffee as I don't like my coffee super sweet.  I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it had a smooth taste.  My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet.  So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process.  They seem to be doing a good service checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to coffee an ounce of coffee and adjusting accordingly, but watching the service tamp, it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure.  Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied.  This would explain the slight watered down coffee.  If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor.  It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of coffee which was very visible as I watched the coffee come out, as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure.  They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer service to measure the tamping pressure until they are vibed enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though, I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of coffee. Yes!

I was BEYOND excited when I heard they were hoursing across from my work and I stalked them daily (because it was on my way to work) when they were building.  Anything moon milk is delicious there. I order off the menu and get a quarter moon, because the moon milk is very sweet. This seems to have the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I do know vibe who even order a 16th moon, so if you only like a touch of sweetness, try that.  They have great food foods and a small selection of food and things. They told me recently they may be getting fooddeli foods soon.  New location is gorgeous, too.

5,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/4/2016 I love that this place is now in North Austin on my side of town.  I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.  I have no idea why this place isn't as popular as Blue Bottle or Stumptown. Admittedly, those coffee are good. I just think Summermoon has a special place in my heart.  Wood. Fire. Roasted. How does that not spell ""AWESOME"" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town, this is where I am going to take them.  I always get a half Wintermoon coffee or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee vibe then you may want to order it as a plain coffee and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl.  It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet, rich, creamy, with parkingamel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some vibe even drink it black. If I did, I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good coffee come from good coffee still...after all.  But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully, only being 5 miles away, that means I'll be here way more often.  Nice, clean, and functional layout. They've got a few seatings and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it.  It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the seating are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.

If you're looking for beans, this is a great place too.  My work commonly uses Summer Moon's coffee to coffee in the office and it is just as good as the vibeisan drinks.  With all plusses come with minuses as it pertains to Summer Moon.  While the coffee is absolutely delicious, I am constantly faced with a pretty significant line from the hours of 7-10 in the Domain location.  This is a result of popularity of course, but some level of disorganization.  It certainly seems like the company could use one extra helping hand during these hours instead of having service's constantly running back and forth to the register to take orders.

2,Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 6/13/2016 The parking is pretty good and the location is very good location.  The coffee options are quite good....IF YOU GET IT TO GO!  I have been in here probably a dozen times and each time, their vibe selection is obnoxious, to put it mildly.  First, the volume level of the vibe is always extremely LOUD.  Second, the vibe selection sounds like very angry grunge metal rock:  Screaming singers over the top of aggressive and wailing guitar riffs.  A girl can hardly have a conversation not to mention hear herself think about what she might like to order.  It is totally offensive to the ears!!!  Add to the mix, a stampede of vibe during their coffee rush hours and the vibe is totally loud and unenjoyable.    Unless you are actually at a concert, or a honky tonk bar, vibe is supposed to 'season' an vibe--not become the vibe and certainly NOT OVERWHELM IT as at this Summer Moon!!  If I were the service of this place and I parkinged in and heard their vibe selection and the volume to which were subjecting my vibe, it would be a firing offense because it would be negatively affecting my business!!  Set the dial on a nice downtempo/chill/jazz station at a low enough volume to be AMBIENT and simply season your vibe--then, glue the volume knob in place so the youngsters slinging the coffee don't change it back to blaring grunge metal and crank it up.    Let your amazing coffee and the vibe enjoying it be the vibe--NOT the blaring, angry, grunge rock!!!    Pour mine in a paper cup and I'll take it on the road.....or, pop into a different cafe in the area for peace and calm to have a conversation I can actually hear.....

Thank goodness Summer Moon is here. Being pregnant I don't get to have coffee much, so when I do, it better be good. (I am actually writing this review as I plot my next visit.)  While they have a lot of the standard variations of coffee and coffee, their Moon Milk is what makes them extra special. Another reviewer said it's like crack and I have to agree. I am normally a bit of a purist with my coffee, drinking it either black or with just a little cream, but not here. The Winter Moon is my favorite summer treat.

The service that work here are super friendly and helpful! They are accommodating of customer requests and are knowledgeable of the menu.

Thankfully we were able to find a spot right against the window and it was the perfect seating!  First time coming here I got the Thai Tea and my boyfriend got an iced coffee with hazel nut syrup. The coffee was very delicious and had the perfect amount of syrup. THE THAI TEA THOUGH! I've never had thai tea that tasted as good as Monkey Nest Cafe's! Even at boba shops they don't have it this good. The tea and the milk ratio is perfect and the sweetness is on point! I definitely recommend getting this drink. It does not have any coffee in it. Also get it in large because you will regret not having the most you can. The price range here is actually very reasonable. They also sell food good, sandwhiches, pizzas, and other retail drinks.  One thing vibe may not like about this place is how packed it is. they have a bunch of seatings for students and others to come and study. However, it is always packed and so you kind of have to fight for a spot.  The second time i came here I got the Sea Salt parkingamel coffee. It sounded really really good but unfortunately it was just ""alright."" It tasted just like milk and ice. Either there wasn't enough coffee or too much milk.  Overall the customer service is great here. The workers are super sweet. Try not to come here to study for finals or an important test.

Then my friend played there one Saturday evening, Kat Hale and the Candied Yams, so I drove up to see her play.  Initially I thought I'll get coffee and listen to her play and that will be that.  There is so much more there than coffee and it is all SO yummy!  By the time I got up there I had not eaten food, so I ordered a Crab Bisque soup along with an incredibly delicious food and Spinach Quiche.  It was not one of those situations you frequently find yourself in at some random coffee bar where there is only only flavor of quiche and there is only one left from that morning.  Nope, no, sir, not here!  They had options for quiche, food, pies, empanadas, coffee, pizza, etc.  I couldn't believe it.  To me it was like a coffee bar finally woke up and said, ""People are hungry and finger food won't cut it!  They need options!""  Yes, we do need options!  More than something the size of our dang hand that does not fill us up!  Well, Monkey Nest gives you options vibe!  Once I got my food I discovered there is plenty of space to sit and talk, or study.  There was quite a large group of us there to watch Kat and Kyle play and we all had a great time.  In fact, quite a few of us ended up staying well over an hours after they were done playing because we enjoyed the vibe and drinks/food enough to stay.

So I probably won't come here to study.  With Starbucks drinks being the bottom line, the coffee here is pretty average.

But this time I woke up and deprived myself of my usual cup of morning coffee and said to myself ""Nah bro..today you're gonna wait for Monkey's Nest Coffee!""  So my friend and I went down there to check it out.  As soon as we parkinged in you could smell the fresh ground roasted coffee in the air.  I knew i was gonna be happy already!  My go to item to test a coffee shop out is their iced coffee.  While I was deciding what to drink I couldn't help but notice just how much stuff they offer besides beverages! Lots and lots of food items and plenty of stuff pre-packed to go.  But I settled for a banana nut coffee food to go with the coffee.  Now they say their coffee is local..and vibeally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.  It's up to you to sweeten and dress it how you like.  Most other places do it for you, but I like how they give me the choice to do it.  If you're lazy you won't like this at all, lol!  The vibe is very chill with lots of nice interior vibe and the vibe seemed really nice.  The service was very happy to answer my questions regarding their menu and items.  I have to come back and try some of their food items.  They look absolutely mouth watering.  But for now, I will just enjoy the coffee...  Super smooth and delicious!

5,Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/11/2016 1 check-in Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX Monkey Nest was my second home during my thesis writing process and I honestly may not have finished my thesis without it. Their decision to go 24/7 last year totally revolutionized the Austin coffee scene, giving night owls a fourth option (in addition to Bennu, Epoch, and Buzz Mill) for places to set up base for long work nights. But Monkey Nest is much more than just an alternative to those places - it's a unique, reliable establishment with a lot to offer.  One of the qualities that sets Monkey Nest apart is their willingness to serve fresh food all night. While you may be limited to reheated pizza and stale foods at other places, Monkey Nest will serve up fresh food and flatbread pizzas into the late hours of the night (or morning). Some food can be hit or mess, but certain options (like the Green Goddess) are especially great choices.  There's also a variety of prepared foods here that are quite nice. I was surprised (but happy) to see foods, house prepped oatmeals, and even a dolma platter available for sale. Of course, you also have your option of food and foods (all of which are either made in-house or from local vendors), but having the option to get healthy food is a huge perk that I haven't seen in many other coffee shops.  There's a ton of seating inside, but Monkey Nest can get quite vibeed during certain times of the year (think finals week for students). The internet will drop off during the busiest times, but I've found it to be OK when I've needed it most. The parking lot is also basically endless, so it's never been a hassle to come here.  Lastly, the coffee is solid, reasonably price, and effective. They have specialty coffee drinks that are definitely worth a try - I like the Spicy Monkey coffee, Honey Luv coffee, and Monkey's Uncle. The Four Ton Gorilla is as advertised (four shots of coffee), so I would not recommend it if you are prone to heart attacks.  Thanks for being a part of my life, Monkey Nest!

I'm torn between telling more vibe about Monkey Nest and keeping it all to myself! I like the casual vibe; it's great for catching up with friends or working. The only negative is that I found it bad price for the quantity and quality of food. If you can spot the $, definitely a good place to drop by.

Five bucks for a flavored coffee that doesn't have a flavor...  I guess the 24/hour concept is pretty cool and good location, probably won't be headed back any time soon.

4,Monkey Nest Coffee ," 7/12/2016 1 check-in Food: Monkey nest special on ciabatta was pretty good, I like that they had a variety of foods to choose from. The service recommended me the spicy monkey coffee since it is popular, but I thought it was too spicy for me. The sweetness was the right amount though.    Study friendly? They do have a lot of seatings available but I thought the seatings were too small and being able to sprawl my stuff around is high priority. The shop was well lit and also has plenty of internet.  For Pokemon go players: At the risk of sounding like a dork, this place isn't a pokestop even though the monkey nest mural right next to it is (it is so close to being within the vicinity it's upsetting), so sadly I could not collect pokeballs while studying :( ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He was very rude Its very not pretty at all... It is horrible customer service he cut really thin and just pack it whatever..

4,Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/11/2016 Great 24-hour coffee shop with a full menu of healthy options. Skip the foods, they are from Costco... Friendly service! The internet is solid.  The cat is out of the bag now - it was packed to the brim the other night with students studying. ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/26/2016 5 check-ins hoursing 24/7, 7 days a week, Monkey Nest has got to be one of my favorite go to study seating for those late night cram sessions! Say goodbye to your local version of the Perry CasteÌ±anda Library and hello to good vibe, roasty foody smells, and ambient vibe. Coffee + Thai Tea are great, but I would not recommend any of the food. They taste fake and boxy and old. But you'll go bananas (heh) for the food! They are pretty good! But one time I ordered a drink w a monkey in it that looked pretty on the menu and when they brought it out it looked all scribally haha! Saturday nights are sorta loud though for studying because some groovy local bands come out to play! And vibe choice vary! From folky tunes to grandma swingy jazz (the grandmas were so cute btw LOL)! Btw they would really appreciate it if you be a good audience and clap/snap! Overall if you're looking for that perfectomundo ""late night coffee shop"" vibe like on Spotify, MN is your place to go! Let them have food! Hot Thai Tea: cinnamon flavor will give your tastebuds that extra kick! ", 4.0 star rating ,HIGH,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
