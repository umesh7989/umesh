I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their vibe to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha coffee and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so vibe, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  price are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super good price, but not too bad price.

I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's hours until 2am. No, really. 3. They have alcohol & alcohol. I didn't know that until I saw the alcohol taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the location - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying hours until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those food & foods, and their colorful matcha-infused coffee. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave.

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable seating). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, internet  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow vibe (the background vibe can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one parkinges. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the seating in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The vibe is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink price are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as food and foods.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The service do a good service maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffee, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of vibe, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Pros: vibe seatinging vibe General vibe Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively bad price Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the vibe, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine coffee down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the vibesy/design vibe having a collaborative meeting.)  The service is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no internet to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of vibe?  seatinging is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella food ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The food is a great idea but the food itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the food crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The food itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a coffee and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory has A+ vibe and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system.

The eclectic selection of seatings, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not good price. The foods range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also coffee coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big seating, little seating, bar seating, regular seatings) is both delightful and refreshing.

We wanted to try their delicious looking foods and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to coffee.  We both ordered the Nutella food and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous vibe and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The food is basically half a food, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The food itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the food. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella food and a fried food food. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other foods, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger vibe and there is definitely no place for high seating. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of seating games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have food with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!

It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated price and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general vibe of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the food and foods and I ordered Nutella foods with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella food, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No internet yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute vibe (props to the designer), but vibe is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed vibe of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay hours till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a alcohol/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the services will rethink their direction.

I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the seating and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude vibe inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful vibe.

You may want to sit near the entrance if you prefer natural vibes. * There's a tall seating area with hanging lights up front, while the other half of the space is filled with small wooden seatings and seating. They also have a sofa all the way at the back. * There's some small seatings and seating outside for extra outdoor seatings. Almost no one ever sit outside though (perhaps because they will be looking directly at a cemetery across the street? Not sure) * Temperature is perfect!!!!! No need to bring extra layers. * I cant seem to get connected to the wi-fi when I sit closer to the front area of the store, but if you sit closer to the back then the wi-fi is great. There's also plenty of electric internet everywhere. * The place is generallt pretty vibe, a mix of vibe chatting and vibe studying or doing work. There's always a handful of UT students, but most of the vibes seems to be non-students.  * Location: Right across a cemetery. It is also next to kebabalicious. There's a small parking lot at front and back side of the store, as well as street parking around the area.  * Service: This place probably have one of the friendliest services in Austin. Food and drinks are also prepared quickly. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

But there's also not much about it that made it stand out to me and the coffee was good but not great.  Worst of all, both times I went in there it smelled badly like a wet towel, which might actually put me off from returning, even thought I only live a flew blocks away.

So hip and perfect for reading a book or enjoying a vibe cup of coffee. The vibe is chill and relaxed and the vibe is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get coffee here and they are hot, not too sweet and delicious. The coffee are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass), the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone food which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each, but I think their vendor went out of business....? The foods are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea.

As soon as I see Yelp pictures of this, I'm there.  I'm not sure why, I've pondered it for quite some time, maybe I need to ask a therapist.  Anyhow, that's what led me here on a Sunday afternoon.  If you are entering from 7th street the parking can be pretty tight.  I think there are only about 2 spaces on the 7th street side of the store.  There is a back alley behind the store where there are a few more seating back there.  There is also a rear entrance to the store you can go through if you parking in the back.  Once inside it has the feel of being in a small house which is pretty cool.  There is a good amount of seating divided into 2 seatings with a huge bar area with stools on both sides.  Great area for working with laptops. Now on to the drinks.  We got a cold coffee and a iced chai coffee.  I had to get cold drinks because again, I'm here for the mason jars.  The iced chai was very refreshing.  It tasted as a chai coffee should with just the right amount of spice. The cold coffee was bold and had good flavor.  No lingering after taste and just what I needed to energize me for the rest of the day. There are so many awesome coffee shops hoursing up all around town.  I would definitely add this one to my list of ones to try if you haven't been here.

Harder to find than you would think... A friend mentioned she thought Vintage Heart was not too loud and I might like it.  Done!  Made that appointment and showed up early to scope the place out. There were a few vibe scattered here and there at 1pm midweek, but it really made me happy that the vibe was not obtrusive and I could find a place to parking.  The counter service were very pleasant and helpful, and I put in my order for a Cinnamon coffee after perusing all of the options. (Um, did I mention they have food goods from Russell's food? - Thankfully not the parkingrot or Italian cream food, because those are my diet kryptonite!)  My coffee came out and was really beautifully done. I have to admit my first thought was,""I bet this is going to have that fruity after taste I often notice in high end coffee.""  Nope. It was exquisite. Dark but not burnt, no fruity tones and no bitter aftertaste. Amazing coffee flavor!  I thought it might be just mine, but my friends who ordered two other flavors of coffee had the same vibe. They both said, ""This is the best coffee I have had in Austin.""  Nice service, Vintage Heart! I will be back and will bring more friends.

I rarely drink it due to my heightened sense of taste and smell. The burnt beans and acidic flavor can sometimes be overwhelming at certain places. Vintage Heart Coffee is one of the very few places where I love to go and actually get myself a cup of coffee. Their lavender coffee is UH-MAY-ZING. I really liked it with the almond milk, too. It has this subtle scent of lavender and fooded marshmallow. The vibe is so cute and vibe, yet very vibesy and trendy! Their service is really great and the location is great if you are in central Austin. If I had the money and lived closer, I would come here every day! The building is covered in vibe on the outside, too. There is not much parking available but many vibe parking or ride their bicycles here so I have never had trouble actually finding parking. I bring my sister here every time she is in town from Dallas along with all of my close friends who are coffee lovers.

I'm super particular about study vibe, and very few would garner a 4-5 star rating from me.  Vintage Heart is warm and comfortable, with bright, natural vibe and fairy lights. It's not hours very late (and probably not too brightly-lit in the evenings anyway), so it's definitely a perfect place to go for those early morning and afternoon study grinds or catch-ups. Although the venue itself is relatively small, Vintage Heart has living-room style couches, a bar, plenty of small and medium-sized seatings, and a larger high seating with lots of working space. Since it's slightly further from location, it's also typically not TOO busy! Good, calm vibe, too, and the perfect amount of background noise. internet is also free and reliable!  The lavender coffee tastes amazing and is super aromatic, and the vanilla coffee is chocolatey and delicious. The heart design on the foam is a nice touch.  One of my favorite things about Vintage Heart, too, is their attention to the vibe and unnecessary waste - they use glass cups and mason jars for both their hot and cold drinks and use pieces of washable, patterned cloth as their napkins. Love it.  The downsides: parking is super difficult with such few lots - it could fit about seven parkings in total. Also, during the peak times in the afternoon, snagging a comfortable study spot can sometimes be difficult and since there is normally only one service making the drinks, there may be a little bit of wait. lavender coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Plops a teabag in a cup of hot water and shoves it over. My eyes narrow to slits, because wtf ... (usually there'll be a pot of coffeeed tea for you or they'll actually take the time to let the tea sit before bringing it to you), but I kiss my teeth, leave a decent tip then go back to have my ""tea"" (had to actually go back to get milk separately ... which is another irritation)  I go back to order the same thing a few hours later (was at the shop all afternoon). And this time, post-tip, I get quicker service, a pot of coffeeed tea, a mug with coffeeed tea poured in, and a special milk container with freshly poured milk ... nary a teabag in sight.  Side. Eye.  So yeah ... I liked this place and will be going back but that whole chain of events kinda got on my nerves. Maybe its because ... you know ... I'm black, and she thought I wouldn't tip (it happens), or maybe she was just having a bad morning, either way ... poor form.  I'm sure they can do better though, it is a nice Austin coffeehop and I'm very pro-Austin-coffeshop so go support this place, because its actually a pretty cute, well laid out, clean with fast internet (sideye @ Patika ... grrr), parking can be a bit of an issue though.  Enjoy.  PS: Will amend to 4 stars when I've gone back a couple of times to make sure poor/erratic service isn't a recurring theme here.  PS2: went back ... service was great. I like.

Given that this is finals season for UT students, I expected to have issues finding a seating or parking, but I really didn't, which was a nice surprise. Given, I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact, it was pretty empty, which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends, it seems to be super packed.  There's a lot of natural light, and the color scheme is easy on the eyes, and the vibe is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha  The vibe is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal seating and seatings, the internet is free and fast (and has an adorable password!), internet are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some seating), the vibe is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of vibe who come--middle aged vibe getting some work done, yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine, college students studying, etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole vibe is pretty chill but for some reason, everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again, maybe I just came at a good time.  A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute, printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy.  In terms of the beverages, the first time I came, I got a hot vanilla coffee, and this time I got an iced vanilla coffee. I also tried my friend's iced coffee, too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The coffee didn't have notes of a super dark, rich coffee, which I'm vibeally ok with. Slightly too sweet, but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. price are on par with other places in Austin.  The service are also very friendly, patient and seem like normal humans.  Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee seating in Austin! I vibeally love the vibe and the beverages.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but considering they make the vanilla syrup in house here it's just kinda disappointing. Makes me feel like I shoulda gotten coffee. Will update this review if I return!  Why 4 stars: this spot is really cute, with warm vibe and lots of seating. It's a great place to get work done (they have internet!) or just meet up with friends.  Cool street vibe outside also.

Their roasted beans are from local Austin Third Coast Coffee Traders.  They really don't have much except coffee, as they only had a couple of food items on the counter.  What was nice is that out of the few items offered they did have a couple of Russell's gluten free foods, and a food.  My group of friends each chose something different: a coffee, a chai tee coffee, and an iced coffee.  The coffee vibe on my friends drink was beautiful.  She mentioned that her coffee was as good as her favorite spot in Brooklyn, my friend liked her Chai, and I absolutely loved my iced coffee served in a cute mason jar.  Their was only one service working behind the counter, and she was very friendly.  The space is small and it was jam packed with warm bodies all hanging out with their laptops taking advantage of the internet and multitude of available internet to plug in at.  They have some tiny fans blowing limited air around, but the place definitely on this 95+ day got stuffy and warm.  We were all melting.

I had heard a lot of great things and with the up and coming EastSide, I figured it was worth checking out when I had some time to kill before pub quiz @ Gourmands.  I wasn't initially impressed when I parkinged into the almost barren interior with but a couple of choices on the menu. But, to my happy surprise they make a killer American for $2.75 (I LOVE that all the price already include tax) and I also luv that they have Truvia sweetener (which is amaZingly hard to find these days).  I planted myself on the very comfy couch (I usually don't sit on coffeehouse couches being the germaphobe that I am, but this one just had that squishy look to it which made me think it would suck me in, which I luv...and I was right!) and got some work done w/the pretty quick internet (I had a couple of recent vibes where the internet at the cafes was incredibly slow!).  I also liked that they don't have disposable napkins or stirrers. My only complaint was the gal behind the counter was a bit cold and standoffish, but that seemed to be her demeanor in general. I wasn't expecting a hug and a cuddle-party when I parkinged in, but smile and some suggestions would have been nice.  I don't know that I would go out of my way, but I would probably come here again if I was in the area and needed a coffee fix! Exterior View from the couch ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

The interior is comfy and vibe, with a mixture of small seatings, couches, and bar seating. I especially love the light fixtures!  The service is super friendly and the inside/bathrooms are clean, too!  The only downside I would have to add is that parking can be difficult (but when is it not in Austin...) and there aren't a ton of places to sit and study, especially if it's a busy day. There are a couple of seatings outside, though, if you don't mind sitting outside. Either way, I love coming here to drink some good coffee and escape the school scene for a bit.

The location seems very homely, and unlike other famous/commercialized/both cafes, this place has a very welcoming feel to it.

The time I stopped by, they used fruity pebble infused-milk for the specialty drink and hear they may be changing it up again. My recommendation to Fleet is to use Froot Loops instead--anyone with me?  The only negatives I can think of is their drinks being overly bad price--the specialty drinks are easily over 6 dollars.

I'm always fascinated with the accentuated taste of a coffee or coffee when there is vibework! Granted it is harder to take the first sip, because you won't want to mess up the coffee vibe.  Fleet uses extremely high quality coffee beans to make their concoctions. Speaking of concoctions, they have several creations with ingredients you wouldn't typically think of combining.  They all mix well together and you'll start to stray from your usual cup of coffee.  Grab a Saturday Morning Ritual infused with fruity pebble milk! They'll even put a homemade fruity pebble treat on the plate. They make them in-house (I've seen these bad boys coming out of the oven and being cut up for service).

I'm a bit of a coffee aficionado and I know a good coffee shop when I visit one; this is the real deal. Just recently hoursed and running like a dream. The two services are the sole service at this joint, and that seems to work because they are seemingly good friends (to vibe and each other). Funnily enough, in talking to one of the service, we found that we had a few common friends from the KCMO coffee scene!! The coffee world is small[ish].  The indoor space at Fleet is tight, but I think it works to encourage vibe to spend some time outdoors or get friendly with their neighbors. The inside is a smallish trapezoid with a low bench online wall and a high bar at another (along the window). Outside, they have several picnic seatings and who doesn't love some good ol' vitamin D?  They have the essential coffee items that one expects, but they also have some interesting drinks they've conjured up for the adventurous coffee drinker. A donut-infused milk drink, a root alcohol coffee beverage, and a delightfully crisp drink which I this is best described as a coffee version of a gin&tonic (obviously, minus the tonic).

First time I visited, I asked for an iced pour over, and they said they could do that, but their iced coffee was actually coffeeed as a pour over and was ready ÌÊ l'instant...so yeah, I went with that.

Thankfully, we found this lovely little coffee shop right next door and ordered some of their third wave coffee.  Fleet's coffee is fresh and tasty, on par with the coffee I'm used to drink in Montreal. I had an iced almond milk coffee and my husband had a double coffee; both were excellent. Fleet deserves a perfect rating for its coffee and courteous service.  The venue is cute but unusually shaped, and unfortunately sits only a few vibe at a time.

There are a few small seatings, a bar looking out the window with bar stools, and some outdoor seating.  The service\barista is very friendly and is happy to answer any questions you may have about the coffee.  They have some very interesting and unique coffee choices which sets this shop apart from others.   I had to go with the morning ritual because who doesn't love a donut hole with their coffee.  Couldn't resist also trying a cold offering and the flip top (root alcohol, chicory, and coffee) caught my attention.  Neither coffee disappointed and overall it was a great vibe and worthwhile trek. If you are a coffee lover this place should definitely be bookmarked and on your short list of coffee shops to visit.  I'm pretty sure you won't leave disappointed.

The coffee is Goldilocks perfect: not too hot, not too cold, not too bitter. But on a hot day, the Claro is great: this is Fleet's lemony twist on an ice-coffee meets alcohol shandy (without the alcohol).  If you are hungry Fleet offers food and foods for food.

After months and months and months of delay, they finally hoursed, and I was there hoursing day. The place is smartly and tastefully designed inside, with an eye towards minimalist aesthetics (or aesthetic minimalism, if you prefer). The focus and passion here is coffee, and it shows.  I've been here multiple times, from morning to afternoon to early evening, and have been greeted warmly and by name by both Lorenzo and Patrick, the services/baristas. They've guided me on a journey of coffee appreciation, and they'll recommend something new, or fix me an old standby with the same passion and dedication.  The price are quite comparable to other coffee shops, they will make coffee to go, and they also sell bagged coffee.  I enjoy sitting at one on of the little seatings inside, or at the window, reading, or working online (free internet, yay!), or chatting with Lorenzo or Patrick if they aren't rushed or busy. I now no longer think that coffee is best served with copious amounts of half and half (I've never enjoyed black coffee until I started going to Fleet), and that coffee can have a flavor profile as every bit as complex and layered as a craft alcohol or bourbon.  The place is small but not cramped, not really a hang-out place, but there's only so much coffee one can consume in a sitting.  It's a warm, intimate, inviting place, and I have high hopes that they stick around, and I've recommended Fleet to friends and foes alike. coffee by Lorenzo.... ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

There is also a seating outside with about 6 seating (IIRC).  That being said, the coffee selection is superb. Also, the area itself is being developed so there are things to see and do.

However with Fleet this notion has been turned on its head; for all the right reasons.  The interior of Fleet is quite small, and while this may take away from being able to sit on some huge armchair and either pass out or space out on a laptop; it encourages the vibe in that space to converse with one another, or better yet the service behind the counter.  As is a hallmark of Lorenzo's attention to detail, the service at Fleet are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they are service & I highly recommend getting into conversations about the quality of the beans they receive, because they'd be more than happy to tell you.  Since (as stated previously) the space is small I also recommend visiting during an off hours so you can enjoy the coffee without having to wait in a long line out the door, but no matter what, you're bound to have a great vibe visiting Fleet.

The location can't be beat- on the lake, plenty of seating (outdoors particularly hellish in the summer) and sweet treats including Amy's ice cream. Coffee, free internet, and the occasional duck on the lake. Pretty place. There's live vibe at times, too. If you're the type that doesn't parkinge that it's touristy and vibeed at all times, if you can tune out all the noise, and if you can find a seating indoors (for most of the year), you'll love it.

It is a little bad price in my opinion, but they have options which is nice.  During the holidays they do a laser light show ... for FREE which is so nice of them.  Beware it draws a ton of vibe.

Their coffee and tea is not anything that has blown me away. It's definitely good, but not much different than other cups of coffee and tea you can find around the area.  On the other hand, the views from the coffeehouse are unbeatable by any other coffeehouse in Austin. You can relax and just watch the sunset while you study or work. It's a great place to meet with friends (both small and big groups) because of the amount of seating available. The cafe is almost always full during peak hours, but there is good enough turnover so that you should be able to find seating fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is also perfect for those days that Austin weather cooperates.  Their deli items are good, but again, not much different than you could get at a typical cafe in Austin.

Beautiful view of a lake. Peaceful vibe. And a lot of outdoor seating.  Clearly other vibe also enjoy this place. The number of seatings available here is insane, but it was still nearly impossible to find seating on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We wandered around and kept finding more floors and more taken seating. We finally found a seating on the corner of the second floor that was free.  Things I noticed while wandering: The lower floors were much vibeer than the top ones. Indoor seating is very limited, so probably not a good idea to chill here if it's hot or raining.  I'm not a coffee vibe, so I was looking at coffee/smoothie/dessert options available on their menu when we arrived. Then I saw they had food. Then I saw they had vegan food. Yes!

Coffee, live vibe, and outdoor seating by the lake...doesn't that just scream Austin?  Came with a friend on a Thursday night around food time and found that it was surprisingly pretty vibeed. The inside is pretty nice although most of the appeal, I suppose, is in the outdoor area where they had someone singing. Additionally, their bathrooms are location outdoors if that's any indication. Nonetheless, they still have plenty of seating indoors if that's not really your scene.  The vibe working there were super friendly even though my friend and I asked way too many questions and took forever to price.  Even though it was nearly 100 degrees, I ordered a hot vanilla coffee and an coffee mousse food. I thought the coffee was fine, although it was a little bitter for me (someone who doesn't like coffee). The food I got seemed bad price to me, especially considering how mediocre I found it to be. It was literally just a dry food doused in coffee, kind of a weird juxtaposition if you ask me.  But I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I really just love the vibe and the coffee honestly is good enough for me.

Can't get much better than sitting on the edge of the lake sipping a delicious coffee and watching the ducks and turtles.  Plenty of shade and seating outside.  Service is usually very good for as busy as they get. If they forget something, they always hop right on it. That's only happened once in a couple years.  The coffee is a proper drink as well with full ristretto shots and a creamy foam on top.  I had the strawberry foodcake this past weekend and it was incredible. Creamy and whipped, light, and rich flavor.  The parking is tough but across from lake Austin Blvd you can parking in the extra lot. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I came here to get a flat white and they were a little confused about what I was asking for. This really looks like one of those mass production, touristy type of coffee places, except that they have free internet, food, lots of (not so good) food, and an amazing outdoor space you can hang out in.  The inside is madness, there are usually two lines to order but you can't really tell, vibe don't really know what they want and spend anywhere between 5-10 minutes ordering sometimes two drinks. The drinks are ok, but the vibe is fun. The service is friendly (but confused) and is eager to help in whatever you need.

I've been there couple times and the vibe is very nice, especially because of the lake! I already tried apple pie and cannoli and of course many types of coffee. The apple pie is good but I didn't like the cannoli....just nothing special and no taste. vibe go there with family and groups and there are many students using seatings with their computers. This month of December they have show of lights with Christmas song every end of each hours. parking is free and is vibeed but there are many seating in both sides of the street. I think almost $7 dollars for a small pie is bad price, maybe they are charging this price because there are many tourists and visitors over there. Most part of service is friendly. They have internet but it doesn't work because many vibe are trying to use it at the same time. So....I think the view worth it more than everything at this place. 4 stars because food and coffee are ok, nothing special to me and really bad price. Also the line to order is big and slow sometimes. Awesome end of Saturday afternoon @ Mozart's deck Coffee + canolli + autuum Canoli ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Anyone that says the food/drinks here are fantastic are really just captivated by the vibe and location of this place...or they have tastebuds that are off, who knows. That's not to say the stuff here isn't GOOD, it's just that it's heavily bad price and presentation over quality seems to be their key to success. I've been here thrice and well, I don't know if I'll be voluntarily going anymore.  I've already forgotten what I got the first two times, but on my most recent visit I ordered their pumpkin shake. $8 for a ""large"" cup (think grande in starbucks terms). Of course, what I expected wa ssomething more of a ""venti"" but nope, this was their large. Now I don't know what it is about their sizes but it seemed like their small cup was just a thinner yet slightly taller version of their large, though not by that much. I wish I asked what the oz were for each size because it was bugging me the entire day.  Anyways, I ordered it on a whim, and on the receipt it said something like ""shake of the week"" or whatever. I didn't see the pricing because it wasn't listed anywhere.  The shake itself was a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and a pumpkin spice pie thrown inside. Ok well, think about it. Vanilla ice cream doesn't have that much of a sweetness to it as other ice creams do; it's a neutral ice cream that can go well with almost anything. Now throw in a pie with a 50-50 crust to insides ratio. That crust tastes like what? Nothing. The sweetness comes straight from the insides of the pie. Throw that alltogether into a shake and you get.....blandness.  An extremely thick and bland shake. Now I will say the pumpkin flavor WAS THERE, but the amount of pumpkin flavor in the shake did not qualify the shake to be called a pumpkin spice shake. If I had any say in what goes on in the menu, I'd say ditch the pie and replace it with a syrup or better yet, trash this garbage item.  Of course there are a plethora of other drinks you can consume here, so I can't really say much for those. I'm no coffee connosseiur, but I did have their coffee here once or twice. Look at the other reviews for their take on the coffee.  Their fruit tarts are rather basic too and their cannoli pales in comparison to other cannoli's I've had, primarily in the filling.  On the flip side, GREAT study spot with a GREAT location. The lights in the evening are rather pretty too...but again, presentation trumps everything for them here.  Also, there's a parking lot across the street that says Oyster Landing parking or whatever. Yes, it's free.  5/10, would come again if someone dragged me here. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

When I go down the stairs there's a huge seating with vibe on their laptops and dogs just relaxing. When you enter there's two lines, it didn't occur to me to go to the other line which was shorter. Then again, I was thinking straight because lo and behold, there's the food display which is basically my kryptonite. Damn!

It gets pretty packed on weekends with young adults/college students.This is the place for vibe watching in Austin.  Cons: internet is not reliable at all.

It is a nice spot for reading a book or chatting with friends though! Their shared restroom needs some work as well.

It's pretty cool. It also has a super chill feel to it - even the writing scratched into the old wooden seatings adds to that feel, as weird as it sounds.  I've gotten to try a lot of their food over the past couple of years, and they have a huge selection of them as well as food drinks. Absolutely loved their tiramisu foodcake - it was the perfect blend of sweetness from the cream, tartness from the cream food, and bitterness from the coffee flavor.

All UT students visit here for coffee, meeting, or for a good time. It can get pretty vibeed, especially during the school time. parking can get difficult but there is a parking lot across street from it that should provide a lot more spaces. I love it's next to a lake. It's seating with lots of seatings for all groups. For their coffee, I like their coffee either hot or cold will work. On a hot Austin summer day, I like the ice cold coffee. All the good memories I had here say a lot about this place.

Mozart's has it all!  The scenery here makes it a perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date for coffee and food. Indoor seating provides the comfort of a climate controlled seating while still offering nice views of the river with their large windows. The only disadvantage with indoor seating is finding a spot to actually sit! Outdoor seating is even better with their seating deck and multitude of benches and seatings. If you get a seating near the river, you can watch the sun set as you share your moment with your date (or mom, depends on whoever you end up taking!).  During the Christmas Holiday's, they set up a spectacular vibe and Christmas light show on their seating. The show is several minutes long and is suitable for both kids and adults. I was very impressed the first time I saw the show and it made a very memorable Holiday vibe. They play it several times a night, but I don't remember the time intervals so it is best to call to find the exact times.  Great place to hang out for coffee, scenery, food, and Christmas light show. This place is a must-go if you are ever visiting Austin. Plan this in your itinerary after you check out Mt. Bonnell (which is only about a ten minute drive).  parking is not easy here since the complex is usually full, especially during weekends, nights, and holidays. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. Delicious slice of chocolate food with a cup of coffee Dusk Sometimes the river runs low and the scenery isn't that great.

If you want coffeeed coffee, the only option is their bottomless cup which is somewhere around $3 so the price is great and the quality isn't something I'd tell everyone about but it's not bad by any means.

Countless dates, hours studying, and hanging out with friends. I moved away, and this Thanksgiving I came home to Austin and shared Mozarts with an out of town relative. Experiencing REAL quality coffee shops elsewhere made me realize how awful Mozarts truly is.  1. Quality of drinks. They move vibe through the line so fast, forget about getting a decent drink. It seems their whole system is so rushed, they have one service sloppily manning the coffee machine, and one service just sloshing milk or whatever into your drink. There are so many things wrong with this. Good coffee must be freshly ground, balanced, and pressed. Milk should be steamed- not just poured from an unrefrigerated box on the counter. 'Baristas' don't price any attention to the amounts of coffee and milk that go into drinks, leaving you with a grainy, too milky drink. Especially for a place that prides itself with roasting its own beans- the coffee consistently falls short of expectations.  2. They still charge $5+ for an coffee drink. Just, no. Horrendously bad price.  3. vibe. The place is always packed. Forget about finding a seating inside. The good news is the outdoor seating is plentiful and comes with great views. However, if it's too cold, too hot, or raining, forget it. Also, the restrooms are outside, and not climate controlled. This leaves them feeling musty like a port-a-potty in the summer, and your bum with icicles in the winter.  If you are a basic bitch, touristy, Starbucks type vibe, you'll be thrilled with the subpar quality of Mozarts pandering to the masses.  If you're anyone else who actually has taste, skip Mozarts.

I've been here before, and the biggest complaint I've heard is ""it's too bad price."" Now, I don't know if it's new or I just never knew before, but they have unlimited iced tea or hot coffee for $3.50, and unlimited iced coffee for $4.75. You can even add flavors (I had 3 glorious cups of pumpkin spice today, haha)!! I don't know if their roasts are good, or if they grind well, or any of that classy stuff, but it's unlimited, man.  My biggest complaint would be WiFi, space, and electric internet. Yes, there's already a LOT of space, and they try hard with the internet. It's just still risky, so if you can, go early, claim a spot, and don't leave till you're done. WiFi seemed to work for some, but not me at all. I ended up hotspotting when I needed to, then just working offline the rest of the time.

Basically, Summer Moon has a milk concoction called ""Moon Milk"" that they put in their Winter Moon (iced) and Summer Moon (hot) coffee varieties. You can choose how much moon milk is in your drinks by getting a straight up FULL summer/winter moon (a little sweet for me, vibeally), half, or even requesting a quarter (not on the menu). My vibeal favorite is the half winter moon (I vibeally am not a fan of hot drinks - but the half summer moon is good too!)  If you're not into sweet deliciousness, you can also get more basic coffee/lattes (good beans, good flavor) and coffee.

I got my coffee shortly after placing the order. The Winter Moon, which claims to have seven secret ingredients, has a general flavor of parkingamel. It was very sweet and it was thicker than your typical coffee, due to the moon milk in it. Don't underestimate the drink; even a size small is quite heavy and it will probably take longer for you to finish than other coffee.

It is no mystery while this place is always hopping. I do wish they had more seating for seating, as there never seems to be ample seating for everyone. I've seen a lot of single vibe sitting in the middle of a big seating spread out. Maybe instead of more bigger seatings, some smaller seatings would be a good idea?  Anyways, four stars for solid coffee, great vibe, and great service. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Sure, the shop specialty blend ""moon milk"" sounds a little sketchy, but once you had it in your choice of coffee, you wouldn't think twice about drinking something called ""moon milk""! While the wood-roasted coffee beans already adds a nice aroma to the coffee, ""moon milk"" adds an unique delicious taste that is perfectly sweet.  Whether you like your coffee hot or cold, in the form of coffee or coffee, just choose a drink that has the word ""moon"" on the menu and you'll be good to go! I definitely recommend grabbing a cup here for perhaps one of the best coffee you will ever have. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I love their wood fired beans.  Something a little different.  While I find their coffee blend a bit too overpowering done as coffee, it is fantastic as an iced coffee!  I sometimes will splurge and add some of their special moon milk.  The moon milk is delicious but VERY sweet. It is a special blend of secret ingredients that they make themselves.  I found out that I can just ask them to reduce the level of sweetness when ordering a drink with moon milk (Very cool!).  I also love their affrogato's with Lick ice cream.  A great little treat on a hot afternoon.    The space is warm and relaxing.  They have free internet and a good seating area to sit down and get some work done.

Their new location is so so so much better and impressive and seating and beautifully vibeated.  If you haven't had their Summermoon and wintermoon specialty coffee, you are missing out. Their ""moon milk"" is so good. Pretty sweet though so I usually ask for a quartermoon if I'm getting a sweet drink. Also, with soy milk or almond milk, it caaan seem a little too nutty.

They have a huge menu of options, not to mention their specialty ""moon milk"" which they use in their drinks. It is heavenly! I've even bought some and used it when making french food and it was delicious!! The service is amazingly friendly, absolutely will remember your name and what your usual is, and they make the most divine coffee. This location gets slammed around 7:45 during the week, but it drops off by 9. The space itself is warm and inviting if you're looking for a place to read or work, or just visit with a friend.  My go to is a Half Moon coffee, which is 1/2 moon milk and half regular milk. It is just the right amount of sweetness for me. This morning I tried their Vanilla Chai coffee and it was so creamy!! It isn't as spicy as some chai's are, so just a heads up about that. Their Summermoon coffee is also amazing, it is made with all moon milk, but be warned it is sweet!  They also have affogato, coffeebrew, various food good, handpies, and sell foodDeli food foods! What more can you ask from a coffee place? Oh and they have a rewards program, after 10 visits you get a free drink. I think it only applies if you price with a parkingd though, but it's nice that they offer it.

I'm particularly fond of the winter half moon, which I inhale as if I had been wandering in the food for months/starving to death/dieting for a year. Rich and smooth and delicious. Even if you get it with soy, it doesn't detract from the taste at all. I also really enjoyed the rich coffee coffee. And all the food goods, but especially that banana food. Just take my money please.  I think the difference comes down to their beans. When you have well roasted beans and good service/technique, you really can't go wrong.  But really, service is nice and work very hard. They never stop moving (I once watched them from the bar for pretty much an entire day...) and are excellent at what they do. The orders come out quickly and well made. I also love the vibe. I love how plentiful internet and seating are.  Everything is great! Come here!

This may sound weird but it almost taste buttery to me. I've been back several times and always order the same thing since it's so good and consistently good every single time.

Knowing I'm quite a coffee fiend he knew I'd take the bait..    The place looks like a cool contemporary coffee spot,  which is very nice.  It sets them apart from your typical ""too cool to look contemporary cool"" coffee joints.    The service behind the bar was very kind and gave great suggestions for what I was wanting to try.  The hooked me up with an coffee ConPanna and an iced coffee blended with their in house sweetened milk creamer.  The coffee was dynamite!  A nice bitter sweet dragon punch to my tastebuds finished off with just enough sweetness to calm it down.  Loved it!  The iced coffee was also a great surprise. It was bold but not acidic and the sweet milk cream did an amazing service of thickening it without making it too sweet.  My buddy and I price the next hours just chillin talkin while sippin our iced coffee.  Normally I put these away quickly but it was too good to not enjoy slowly.  The mood of the place is mellow and relaxed.  Definitely a place I'd like to visit again.    Best of all was the price!  Normally for two premium drinks like that I'd price over $8 at most other coffee seating but here it was just over $5 and that is one hell of a bang for your buck!  Highly recommend you check it out if you're in the mood for a mellow place to enjoy premium coffee at a great price! Close up of the coffee ConPanna Ice coffee and coffee ConPanna Menu shot!

I will never know but I will be forever thankful for it. For some reason their summer moon/winter moon tastes a bit different from the south location. It's still good but seems a little stronger/less sweet? Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some foodDeli food foods (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study seating since I moved north. They have a good amount of big hours seatings and it seems like a lot of vibe come to just get work done. There are always rushes of vibe and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and vibe. I also really like the vibe they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay hours later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near location where more students need those late night coffee shops. It's unfortunate but I guess it makes me want to get work done faster. Summermoon coffee , 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The hype over their moon milk was enticing, and I was truly interested.  However, the long delay of me trying it was caused by the combination of being no where close to a Summer Moon (fueled by laziness of driving through location), and I wasn't sure if they had lactose-free substitutes of their Moon Milk.  I was at the Chilantro next door with a large party and a couple of them headed over the Summer Moon for coffee.  I asked and they had almond and soy substitutes, and this place was definitely much closer and more easily accessible.  The opportunity was finally here!  After a 100-plus degree afternoon price at Walnut Creek Metropolitan parking, I was drenched in sweat and needed re-hydration.  The perfect excuse!  parkinging in, your nose gets hit with a strong wave of coffee aroma.  Stronger than Starbucks in my opinion.  This place really advertises for itself.  I ordered the Wintermoon with soy as well as a cup of ice water.  They hype is real!  The Wintermoon is an iced coffee with moon milk and it was absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet, but since the drink isn't thick like a frapp, the flavors aren't overwhelming.  I don't like the taste of hot coffee, but I'm a huge fan of coffee flavored anything, so this drink is essentially everything I love in a cup.  If you need me, I'm here on the Summer Moon fan train.

What is this moon milk medley that you have created?! I know it's a secret so I won't keep prying, but whatever this heavenly nectar is that you've concocted it's amazing. I saw on Yelp vibe rave reviewing about their summer moon coffee so I had to try it. My bf and I snagged one each and I was totally blown away; it's sweet, creamy, and actually 'velvety,' if a coffee could ever be compared to that of a fancy plush couch.  I could handle drinking a summer moon coffee everyday, but the friendly and helpful service said that the half moon coffee is pretty popular for those that don't want so much sweetness.  The interior is cute and simple, it's going for a 'cool coffee shop' vibe but is actually cool about it. So cool in fact that every single seating was occupied but someone on their laptop... maybe some more seatings are in order.  Go order a summer moon coffee. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

Since I don't deal with ""mystery"" ingredients, I can't comment on their moon-milk type drinks, but they seem to be pretty popular. (My boyfriend thinks there's butterscotch in it, at least based on the hot chocolate.) Their Velvet black coffee or an almond milk coffee are my usual orders, and both are excellent. In fact, given that almond milk coffee is pretty much my ""test"" for a coffee shop, I think they're my #1 at the moment.  I like the vibe a lot, and for me it's a good location place to meet up with vibe. parking is usually OK (I'd suggest parking more toward the LASIK-side for more spaces and less congestion). I also like that they have some gluten free food options. My favorite is the food pot (hand) pie.  My nits? The front door is freaking HEAVY! Also it's much too cold for my liking to actually work inside. So I usually stay outside and it's fine; there are only a few outdoor seatings but I've never had a problem getting one. Sometimes if they are busy they are very slow getting orders done. It once took me 20 minutes to get my coffee, but the dude realize this and delivered it to me outside! Also the hand pies are so good but they could be a bit bigger. :-) ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are, which is nice when trying a new coffee house.  I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar.  They have a variety of different types of seating from couches to seatings for working with laptops, to a bar\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee.  I ordered a half summer moon coffee as I don't like my coffee super sweet.  I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it had a smooth taste.  My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet.  So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process.  They seem to be doing a good service checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to coffee an ounce of coffee and adjusting accordingly, but watching the service tamp, it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure.  Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied.  This would explain the slight watered down coffee.  If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor.  It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of coffee which was very visible as I watched the coffee come out, as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure.  They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer service to measure the tamping pressure until they are vibed enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though, I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of coffee. Yes!

I order off the menu and get a quarter moon, because the moon milk is very sweet. This seems to have the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I do know vibe who even order a 16th moon, so if you only like a touch of sweetness, try that.  They have great food foods and a small selection of food and things.

I always get a half Wintermoon coffee or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods.

I'll be back only because I don't venture to south Austin very much and because of their coffee products, but please crack a smile now and then and see how it perks up the place.

The drinks are delicious and it's arguably my favorite coffee in Austin in terms of taste.  Try the coffee Moon coffee Iced, the Winter Moon, or my girlfriend's favorite, the 007.  All of these drinks do the trick and give you that delicious and much needed buzz in the morning.  If you're looking for beans, this is a great place too.  My work commonly uses Summer Moon's coffee to coffee in the office and it is just as good as the vibeisan drinks.  With all plusses come with minuses as it pertains to Summer Moon.  While the coffee is absolutely delicious, I am constantly faced with a pretty significant line from the hours of 7-10 in the Domain location.  This is a result of popularity of course, but some level of disorganization.  It certainly seems like the company could use one extra helping hand during these hours instead of having service's constantly running back and forth to the register to take orders.  If you're coming in early, be prepared to wait a good 10-15 for your drink.  Don't come in a rush.  Thanks Summer Moon.  Despite my small constructive criticism you and your service rock!

The coffee options are quite good....IF YOU GET IT TO GO!  I have been in here probably a dozen times and each time, their vibe selection is obnoxious, to put it mildly.  First, the volume level of the vibe is always extremely LOUD.  Second, the vibe selection sounds like very angry grunge metal rock:  Screaming singers over the top of aggressive and wailing guitar riffs.  A girl can hardly have a conversation not to mention hear herself think about what she might like to order.  It is totally offensive to the ears!!!  Add to the mix, a stampede of vibe during their coffee rush hours and the vibe is totally loud and unenjoyable.    Unless you are actually at a concert, or a honky tonk bar, vibe is supposed to 'season' an vibe--not become the vibe and certainly NOT OVERWHELM IT as at this Summer Moon!!  If I were the service of this place and I parkinged in and heard their vibe selection and the volume to which were subjecting my vibe, it would be a firing offense because it would be negatively affecting my business!!  Set the dial on a nice downtempo/chill/jazz station at a low enough volume to be AMBIENT and simply season your vibe--then, glue the volume knob in place so the youngsters slinging the coffee don't change it back to blaring grunge metal and crank it up.    Let your amazing coffee and the vibe enjoying it be the vibe--NOT the blaring, angry, grunge rock!!!

Thankfully we were able to find a spot right against the window and it was the perfect seating!  First time coming here I got the Thai Tea and my boyfriend got an iced coffee with hazel nut syrup. The coffee was very delicious and had the perfect amount of syrup. THE THAI TEA THOUGH! I've never had thai tea that tasted as good as Monkey Nest Cafe's! Even at boba shops they don't have it this good. The tea and the milk ratio is perfect and the sweetness is on point! I definitely recommend getting this drink. It does not have any coffee in it. Also get it in large because you will regret not having the most you can. The price range here is actually very reasonable. They also sell food good, sandwhiches, pizzas, and other retail drinks.  One thing vibe may not like about this place is how packed it is. they have a bunch of seatings for students and others to come and study. However, it is always packed and so you kind of have to fight for a spot.  The second time i came here I got the Sea Salt parkingamel coffee. It sounded really really good but unfortunately it was just ""alright."" It tasted just like milk and ice. Either there wasn't enough coffee or too much milk.  Overall the customer service is great here. The workers are super sweet. Try not to come here to study for finals or an important test.

There is so much more there than coffee and it is all SO yummy!  By the time I got up there I had not eaten food, so I ordered a Crab Bisque soup along with an incredibly delicious food and Spinach Quiche.  It was not one of those situations you frequently find yourself in at some random coffee bar where there is only only flavor of quiche and there is only one left from that morning.  Nope, no, sir, not here!  They had options for quiche, food, pies, empanadas, coffee, pizza, etc.  I couldn't believe it.  To me it was like a coffee bar finally woke up and said, ""People are hungry and finger food won't cut it!  They need options!""  Yes, we do need options!  More than something the size of our dang hand that does not fill us up!  Well, Monkey Nest gives you options vibe!  Once I got my food I discovered there is plenty of space to sit and talk, or study.  There was quite a large group of us there to watch Kat and Kyle play and we all had a great time.  In fact, quite a few of us ended up staying well over an hours after they were done playing because we enjoyed the vibe and drinks/food enough to stay.

But this time I woke up and deprived myself of my usual cup of morning coffee and said to myself ""Nah bro..today you're gonna wait for Monkey's Nest Coffee!""

My go to item to test a coffee shop out is their iced coffee.  While I was deciding what to drink I couldn't help but notice just how much stuff they offer besides beverages! Lots and lots of food items and plenty of stuff pre-packed to go.  But I settled for a banana nut coffee food to go with the coffee.  Now they say their coffee is local..and vibeally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.  It's up to you to sweeten and dress it how you like.  Most other places do it for you, but I like how they give me the choice to do it.  If you're lazy you won't like this at all, lol!  The vibe is very chill with lots of nice interior vibe and the vibe seemed really nice.  The service was very happy to answer my questions regarding their menu and items.  I have to come back and try some of their food items.  They look absolutely mouth watering.  But for now, I will just enjoy the coffee...  Super smooth and delicious!

Nasty.  Watered down iced coffee, dry foods and monkey crap tasting coffee. At least starbucks coffee tastes like coffee. Tasted like tea and the spicy coffee thing, I don't even know how to describe it, just not coffee. Not drinkable.  The vibe is dead and dreary.

It was impressive to see the service act as a well-oiled machine.  I had the Italian food at food and it was perfect.

Their decision to go 24/7 last year totally revolutionized the Austin coffee scene, giving night owls a fourth option (in addition to Bennu, Epoch, and Buzz Mill) for places to set up base for long work nights. But Monkey Nest is much more than just an alternative to those places - it's a unique, reliable establishment with a lot to offer.  One of the qualities that sets Monkey Nest apart is their willingness to serve fresh food all night. While you may be limited to reheated pizza and stale foods at other places, Monkey Nest will serve up fresh food and flatbread pizzas into the late hours of the night (or morning). Some food can be hit or mess, but certain options (like the Green Goddess) are especially great choices.  There's also a variety of prepared foods here that are quite nice. I was surprised (but happy) to see foods, house prepped oatmeals, and even a dolma platter available for sale. Of course, you also have your option of food and foods (all of which are either made in-house or from local vendors), but having the option to get healthy food is a huge perk that I haven't seen in many other coffee shops.  There's a ton of seating inside, but Monkey Nest can get quite vibeed during certain times of the year (think finals week for students). The internet will drop off during the busiest times, but I've found it to be OK when I've needed it most. The parking lot is also basically endless, so it's never been a hassle to come here.  Lastly, the coffee is solid, reasonably price, and effective. They have specialty coffee drinks that are definitely worth a try - I like the Spicy Monkey coffee, Honey Luv coffee, and Monkey's Uncle. The Four Ton Gorilla is as advertised (four shots of coffee), so I would not recommend it if you are prone to heart attacks.  Thanks for being a part of my life, Monkey Nest!

The food items were perfect for a grab-and-go customer. I also enjoyed their smoothie. I saw some other interesting items offered like quiche and empanadas. I'm torn between telling more vibe about Monkey Nest and keeping it all to myself! I like the casual vibe; it's great for catching up with friends or working.

Everyone seatinged by us were very vibe and I felt weird speaking in a low voice, so this seems to be a great study location. I am not a huge coffee vibe because it is never perfect, either too sweet or too much coffee aftertaste. I ordered a chocolate chimp and the first thing that caught my eye was the foam design. It was in the shape of a chimp. I didn't even know that was possible, perfect presentation. The taste was amazing as well, not too sweet and no bad coffee aftertaste.

However, ALL were delicious and I appreciate a good coffee. Spiced brown sugar is an excellent choice :) We also got iced tropical green tea with lemonade - it tastes nothing like starbucks, but was very refreshing and enjoyable!  We also got food today and were VERY happy. We ordered the food mozzarella basil pesto pizza, and the grilled food with chips and salsa. The grilled food was $4.99 with feta and mozzarella and was incredible. It's hard to mess up a grilled food, but it's always nice to get one exceptionally good. The pizza was very filling and the food tasted fresh. We shared both and were not hungry at all after.  We were helped by a different round of service from yesterday (where are you, Josh?) but they were just as nice and helpful. They checked to make sure our large order was correct, which I appreciated. Food came out fast, and I can't imagine why vibe would complain about the wait time.

Well she goes off and rambles on the price stipend my husband receives...I felt a little awkward and agree to the number she mentions, ""yea it's something like that.""

So I was thinking about doing a list of all the Starbucks in town, which means I would have to bat out a bunch of reviews on the Starbucks I haven't reviewed already, and suddenly that seemed like a lot of repetitive work. So let's talk about Monkey Nest instead.  And I'll make it quick: I'm a fan of Monkey Nest because I'm a fan of Monkey Nest. It's consistent, it's dependable, and I've always found a place to parking and sit. Sometimes, that's all I need. And when I think about it, I've done coffee here with just about everyone I know in Austin, at one time or another, and that makes it a little more special to me. I can think of certain vibe right now, and Monkey Nest will invariably come to mind.    The straight coffee's always been okay, I know nothing about their Monkey coffee or Monkey Chai, and they have a real kitchen making real food. I'm kind of fascinated with their giant bowl of boiled foods and Monkey food in the counter display. Lots of foods & stuff too. I'm pretty sure they also have live vibe certain nights, but don't quote me, because I'm mainly here in the daytime.  Monkey Nest is apparently doing well, they've just hoursed a new nest around UT, and I'm genuinely happy for their success. I know there are Monkey deals during Monkey Happy hours, I just don't know what they are. But I do have a Monkey punch parkingd. It occurs to me this review is a little all over the place, maybe like a bunch of monkeys, um, looking for a nest. Okay, we'll approach this philosophically: Austin is to Monkey Nest, what Life is to - oh, make up your own ending. I gonna go have a coffee moment. Yes, they have highchairs here. Handy for conversing with toddlers. If you're a regular here, they've rearranged the little fireplace/stage area. Disrupts my sense of stability... They make their own food foods here. The vegan doesn't suck. Central Market is hard to beat though. See all photos from Errol M. for Monkey Nest Coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Comfortable and easy-going, like you would expect from a coffee shop. As I waited for my order, I couldn't help but to observe my surroundings. The vibe and branding felt so classic-Austin (or at least the Austin/Burnet Road I fell in love with in the first place), versus some of the newer ""cool"" concepts that are just a bit too contrived.  Liked the variety of food and drink options on the menu. And though I came at regular hours, the 24-hour factor is great.  I ordered a regular cup of coffee and the Green Friend smoothie with protein. Thought the smoothie was too sweet, like someone dumped Fun Dip in it, but maybe I just ordered wrong. It also took 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which seemed excessive considering I didn't have to wait in line to order and my coffee was given to me immediately.

It's syrup and sparkling water. That's it. But the ""barista"" at Monkey Nest seemed to think it was rocket science because whatever they called ""Italian soda"" was absolutely disgusting. I asked for more syrup, hoping it would fix the issue. Instead, I just got more attitude. I wish I hadn't tipped as well as I did. For 20 bucks for some fruit, a coffee, a yogurt, and a ""Italian soda"" -- it better be awesome.  Husband says the coffee is decent. Fruit was subpar and yogurt was pathetic.  Never coming back here.

The service is very friendly and the drinks are delicious. I think what sets this shop apart from the rest for me is the Dolmas platter they have. Delicious and filling at under 5$, its something no other coffee shop has and I'm addicted. I usually get my coffee to-go or am able to sit outside during the cooler months.

I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black, iced, no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision.  For food, please please please try the monkey food. It has honey, walnuts, maple syrup and God knows what else.  For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy food options as well as gluten-free and vegan options.  And finally for food, the food pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need.

Delicious alcohol by (mostly) Texas craft coffeeers. On tap and by the bottle in a rotating selection of brands like South Austin, Founders, Real Ale, Adelbert's, Stone, Breckenridge, Deep Ellum, Odell, Left Hand. Served by a friendly, handsome, Southern gentleman who called me ""Ma'am"" in an alluring way that made me want to order another round. When I expressed curiosity about one of the selections, he immediately produced a sample glass. Swoon.  alcohol, for my proper lady friends who don't want to drink delicious alcohol. There were a few decent choices in red and white, plus a prosecco for my bubbly-lovers.  Price point, not bad at all for the hoity-toity Domain. Coffee drinks range from $2.30 - $3.50, fresh juice blends are $7, alcohols range from $4-$7. Happy hours from 4-7p with $1 off drafts & alcohols by the glass :-)  service assorted convenience foods from local stars: food (by Quack's), food foods (by Tyson), and food & foods (by Fricano's).  Bright, modern vibe, with tons of natural vibe and plenty of seating for dining, sipping, or even working.

Delicious and nutty.. perfectly roasted flavors and tasty frothy foam.  One of the best I've had here in Austin.  They guys behind the counter were really outgoing, energetic and friendly.  They were eager to let us sample some of the coffee coffee they had.  I fell in love with their signature roast the most.  Finally my palette is starting to acquire a taste for coffee without all the syrups and creamers and garbage, so I am pretty stoked about buying from places like this.  They also offered the chance to try their alcohols but after drinking a coffee I don't think my stomach would have appreciated it lol!

The Chai was very well executed but lacked character in the chai tea blend used.  Most of the spices were muted with only clove as the dominant flavor.  It wasn't really our cup of tea.  The coffee and pour over were both good, bold, and flavorful.  The high quality of coffee used for both reflected in the final products.

The service approached us as we left to introduce himself and let us know he was thankful that we dropped by on hoursing day which was nice.

The service are friendly, but I've noticed on more than one occasion that miscommunication, or lack thereof, seemed to be an issue here.  One time, I had made an order and waited 8-10 minutes (the vibe who had made an order before already received hers 5 minutes prior). I went up and asked about my order and the service realized the vibe taking orders never gave her the slip for my order. In the end, the situation was rectified but this mistake was something worth noting especially since it was not busy that time of day.  On another visit, I had asked for an iced coffee (specifically requested a coffee coffee with ice--I know, I'm weird), I noticed the charge not equaling what was on the menu. I had then asked the lady taking the order and she said she was going to charge me for a cold coffee. Looking back at this situation, it would have been nice if she said this upfront rather than me having to ask.  In the end, Apanas, once known as Two Hands, is far from perfect.

I've had everything from their coffee based drinks to their coffee coffee to their coffee and foods. food goods are delicious and not made in house. Both their coffee coffee were VERY sour - so sour that I thought it was the creamer. The coffee are unspectacular and not that kind of gorgeous smooth rich taste I would expect from a fancy place like this. There was that acidic aftertaste. Their coffee just taste nondescript. I never finished mine. To top it all off, this place is pretty pricy.  Their vibe looks nice but isn't exactly the most comfortable. I wasn't a huge fan of their seating seating on the inside set up, as the seating dug into my thighs. There are only plugs along the wall. seatings become scarce the moment the populous wakes up i.e. any time that's not 8am. All of which are things I would live with it they had better coffee.  I do love their vibe choice though! ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

But I've only had one thing on the menu here, so I don't want to get ahead of myself.  I wish Two Hands Coffee was just a little bit closer because I pretty much love it here. The interior is beautiful, seating, brightly lit, and provides a really welcoming vibe with good vibe softly playing in the background. Good amount of hours seating near internet on a Tuesday evening. The service were very friendly--I mean, I didn't talk to them much but sometimes you parking into a place, and you kinda get the wrong vibe, if you know what I mean? Not here. Not even close. And they bring out your drink to you, which is so nice.  They serve a variety of things in addition to coffee: alcohol, alcohol, juice, food, food. My classic to-go drink is an iced vanilla coffee, which was great (a tad on the sweeter side). I'm looking forward to trying their other items because it's such a great place to study or even just to just grab a cup of coffee (or alcohol) with your friends.  Also, they have a really cute seating for those who want to bask in good weather.  My only complaint is that if it gets loud, it resonates kind of fast because everything bounces off the concrete floor and wooden panels. Maybe if there were more sound absorbing material somewhere?  Anyway, great coffee, great service, great vibe. Will be back! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

There were plenty of seatings and a decent amount of plugs so if you come, you can do so without fear that your electronics will run out of battery. Most of the seatings are can seating 2-4 vibe. Bathroom was pretty clean, no complaints about anything.  The coffee was okay. Nothing crazy. Some of the other reviews have said that it was very sharp. I can't deny that point. The coffee is better than the stuff that you could make at home (for an average vibe, not a coffee connoisseur), however it's not anything I'd come back for.

Although it can get noisy, I thought I discovered the absolute perfect coffee shop in North Austin. I can still say that I do like the vibe, that their coffee is delicious, and that their service is extremely friendly.  However, I don't think I'll be returning after tonight. My seating was approached by a vibe (presumably the service/manager) who announced to everyone in my area (but actually @ me) that in the future, he'd appreciate it if we (I) purchased something, even if it's small, since we're (I'm) using their Wi-Fi & taking up a seating. Yes, I do see that those are very valid points, however, I have mixed feelings about them even being addressed (and particularly about the manner in which he approached it). So I'm now writing this review from my iPad while on my iPhone's vibeal hotspot lol.  In my opinion, I think vibe help a business in very direct (purchasing a product) and indirect ways. On one hand, I hadn't been buying and probably wouldn't have bought a coffee or food every time I studied here (which would have been pretty often since I was intent on being a regular). On the other hand, I was sold on everything about their coffee shop and raved to others about how great it is, that they should try it, etc.  So how many times can I go without purchasing before I have to buy again? Is there some sort of coffee shop etiquette I'm not aware of? (These are not sarcastic questions btw). I think tonight marked my 4th visit, and to be honest, I was thinking about buying a coffee before I was approached.  Maybe I'm just used to waltzing into my local noisy Starbucks and studying there without purchasing something like *ever*... but I guess I'll be returning there to study from now on.  I may come back when I'm over this, but for now, I'll pass on Two Hands Coffee and I'll probably tell my friends to do the same.  (But if you go, do try their coffee with hazelnut. It's delicious.)

I have years of retail management vibe and this would never fly.  The first time I stepped into the shop a couple weeks ago I was so happy that a coffee shop was so close to my place and I love supporting local! Well.... I peeked my head in to see if it was ok to bring my dog for a short moment to order and go. I saw a woman at a seating near the register with hers so I figured it was fine but wanted to keep us by the door so not to disturb vibe relaxing. The lady's order was called and when she stepped up the service told her next time your dog is not allowed. She said ok sorry and went out in the seating to have her drink. I asked her if she minded that I tie mine by the door  and she told me I come here all the time and have never been told that. I went in ordered and left. I returned the next day and parkinged in with my pup, made him sit next to me by the parking close to the door to be out of the way and we ordered. I asked if it was fine that I order with him and we leave. The guys said, ""yes of course do you want a treat?""  I went in yesterday no problem; stood close to the door and out of the way to order and left with my pup.  Today was not the case. We went to our normal area to order. And stood. No greeting, no I'll be with you in a moment, no acknowledgement. I waited for the service to finish his lively convo with someone he knew and waited. Then he took another order from someone wading around the area. And I waited. Then a couple parkings in and up the counter and when I thought he would turn to take my order he asked for theirs.

If the quality and vibe of Two Hands is any example of what is coming then they are on point 100%.  I decided to order two items just to get a sample of their menu. I ordered a Mixed Greens Juice and a Chai Tea coffee. The Chai is delicious, just the right amount of spice, it was the perfect temperature and blows the socks off any I can remember. The Mixed Greens Juice is really good, really fresh and flavorful.  The price are not too bad, the Chai was $4 and the Mixed Greens was $7. I noticed that they had a nice offering of foods and food on their menu. They also offer an assortment of food goods. Their drinks menu has plenty to choose from and I am excited to keep trying it all out.  The best part for me was the service. The service and the sweet lady at the counter were both welcoming, friendly and talkative. They made me feel like I wanted to stay and have a chat with them.  Anyone that chooses to go to the Starbucks a few streets over is out of their mind. This place has everything a coffee place could offer. The interior was inviting and well vibeated. Nothing about Two Hands feels generic. It is a perfect addition and I can't wait to go back! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The attention to detail is so thoughtful and the quality of the product is outstanding! Talking with Aamil the service is so fun he is kind and so knowledgable! He has a passion for his products and even gives back to some of the farmers! He has 6 tap handles of all craft alcohol and a list of fresh juices which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't love coffee as much as my Boyfriend does! They even have happy hours Monday-Friday -$1.00 draft alcohol... I'm in heaven! Keep up the great work Two Hands! We will be back :) Beautiful coffee! service Aamil.

However, the location does little to offer for coffee other than Starbucks, the coffeeing seating and restaurant coffee. Until now  Two Hands Coffee is a coffee shop my girlfriend, who already posted a review that is probably more insightful and enjoyable to read, recommended to me (by that I mean forced to tag along). The shop sits on Rock Rose ave, a hidden road that will be filled with new stores in the Domain. At first glance upon the minimal yet appealing vibe, I knew I was in for a treat.  I took my gf and two sisters to try this place out. We ordered two vanilla iced coffee, a special Juice (I forget the name but I remember the price of $7) and a hot coffee for about $20, fairly price! I noticed that their food options are from Quacks, which is a local food near me that I often enjoy a pie or two. Coffee was good and to everyone's liking, but most importantly the juice apparently made my sister feel healthier within 5 minutes of drinking it. Wow  The vast interior and high ceilings give an hours, relaxed vibe to the shop. Order your drinks/food, get handed a number and find a relaxing seating next to their huge window or a nice seating with friends and a few minutes later someone will come out and bring your order to you. First time I've vibed this in a coffee shop!  Upon leaving, the manager/owner (i'm not too sure) came up to greet and thank us for our visit! An extremely nice gesture that gave me the extra push to declare this neat coffee shop as my new go-to coffee shop outside of home! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

Previously known as Two Hands, Apanas is great for coffee and alcohol/wine drinkers. I especially like that they offer both options because I have a couple of friends that don't drink so this place caters to both of our moods :) They also have juices and food as well so it's more than just your typical coffee shop. The vibe is cool and the service is superb! I've gone on both week nights and weekend nights and have always had a pleasant vibe. Sometimes there is a vibeian playing live vibe which is always delightful. I highly recommend stopping here. Only downfall is that the close ""15 minute parking"" section isn't always hours to the public, and the parking garages are kinda far from the shop itself. So if you plan to stop in ""quick"" to get coffee on-the-go, it may take you about 15 minutes just to find a parking spot and then parking there. Otherwise, I'm still happy to go back. I just need to be sure I have enough time alloted! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I gave this business two stars for their coffee because the coffee itself was about the only enjoyable part of our vibe. If you're in the area and need a quick pick-me-up I'd still hit this place up over Starbucks... Unless you're in a hurry. If you are, then just forget it.  The vibe is nice, but not quite nice enough for those prime real estate. There just seems to be something missing in the vibe. The place just feels a bit dead and the service didn't seem to add much life into the place either.  My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a shot and were disappointed by the service-time and the service. After placing your order, they hand you a number so that they can deliver it to your seating. We were waiting for what seemed to be much longer than typical for a coffee shop, so I stepped back in from the seating to see if they had forgotten our order. They assured me that they were still working on it... Odd, since we had only seen a couple vibe in line before us. I went back outside to wait some more... Waiting... Waiting... Finally, I went back inside to see what was taking so long. I asked again where things were at and my question was met with a tone that communicated ""we're working on it you impatient customer,"" to which I asked to speak to the manager. Turns out that was the manager, so I asked him to have a word with me after he finished our drinks. He stepped aside and I explained that we felt we'd been waiting for like 20 minutes... And rather than apologizing for the inconvenience, he stopped me, parkinged over to the receipt printer and checked the time stamp on our order so that he could challenge me on how long we had actually been waiting. REALLY!?! A customer is upset about how long things are taking and you want to argue with them about details? Wow! Anyways, 10 minutes. That's how long he admitted it had been already... And our drinks still weren't made. I've visited over 30 coffee shops (literally) in Austin and I can't remember it ever taking that long to make a couple of simple coffee drinks, even with a line in front of me. But the bigger issue was the manager's attitude. He proceeded to ask me with an air of condescension if we were in a hurry ""or something."" He explained that they had had a spill, that they could only pull three shots at a time, etc, etc... I wasn't asking for any freebies or handouts, just some respect and an apologetic tone for taking so long. All I felt like I got was defensiveness.  After waiting outside for a few more minutes, we were finally brought our drinks. There was no offer to make things right or a check to see if anything else could be done to ensure our vibe was a good one. Needless to say the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be returning anytime soon. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

I tried their coffee and their hazelnut coffee and overall the coffee hits the right spot. So as a coffee house it does what it's supposed to do !  As much as I wanted to i could not take away two stars (felt really mean to do that ) for two major faults (one because of the location and two, well.. )  1. parking is a nightmare if you plan to come here during weekends. This Is because of the location,I understand so I did not take away the star. Haven't been here during weekdays so don't know how the situation is then.  2. INTERNET connection issues.. now a days coffee shops have become more of a working seating than just coffee drinking spot.. and it feels that their Internet just poops out if there are too many vibe in the spot.

Their coffee is just simply delicious. No bitterness ever. One day I will move past their parkingamel coffee to try something else like the excellent pour over coffee that everyone raves about, but for now I'm happy with my coffee. Aamil the service is such a pro when it comes to hospitality.  You can tell he parkinges and you'll usually see him working his butt off and interacting with vibe.  You won't find any cranky too cool for school service working here.  The service is nothing short of amazing.  Everyone is really approachable and will offer suggestions.

The space was nice and vibe, there is nice vibe on the walls and the service is great.  I didn't have a hard time parking and there was only a 3 minute wait to order my food.  Full disclosure, I didn't come here for coffee.  I came here to grab a quick food and work for about an hours.  I grabbed a caprese food and the lemon lime ginger echinacea soda.  Unfortunately they were both awful.  I really wanted to like them  I was really hungry and this set me back $13 with tax & tip.  But the food had just been pulled out of the fridge and was a half food- for $7.50, you can just give me the whole thing.  But really it would have just been a whole food of sad.  There was no flavor and the food had been soaked through in places so the texture was gross.  Luckily it came with a bag of chips which was definitely the best part of my food.  Then I tried to wash the chips down with some of the soda and it was so disappointing!  It was over parkingbonated, and also has little flavor.  Maybe they forgot to add sugar to it? I'm not sure.

Naimen is the service/operator and the most knowledgeable vibe on coffee I have ever met.  If this isn't obvious in the craftsmanship he applies to his trade, then you aren't a true coffee fan. If you continue to visit and listen to his coffee conversations, you can't help but learn a ton.    Now for the coffee...I am a traditional coffee vibe.   I like my coffee black, no cream, no sugar; so yes, I am boring.   I find those that order their triple half-caff double Chia coffee with cinnamon revolting vibe that talk more about themselves, the Kardashians, vaccinations and whatever other mindless nonsensical fad happens to be popular.  You can find these vibe at the green and white place happily displaying their latest technology as a status symbol, but I digress.    I was so impressed with Naiman's knowledge I threw caution to the wind and left my coffee vibe in his hands.  He had no clue that I liked my coffee plain Jane with the only question being ""whole milk?"", to which I said ""yes.""   After the typical slam bang of the coffee machine I was presented with the non-descript white cup with the to-go lid in place.  I didn't parkinge to take the lid off top to see what was inside as the first sip would tell me more than any visual.  As I take that first sip, he asks, ""So?""  My mind is now seriously confused.   I detected a bit of coffee but the strength of the coffee bean and the silky smooth sensation of real whole milk froth.   I ponder the fact that I like this; no, I REALLY like this.  My response is a guarded one of ""CafÌ© coffee but there is something strange and delicious."" His response startled me.  Naimen revels to my shock and horror that I just had a ""BLACKBERRY LATTE!""  I think to myself, how can this be?  I am a normal blue collar coffee type!  I am not a one bite fruit guy.  I love my droid and my Linux and my old school punk and all things anti-latte, yet I somehow love this blend.   The elegance of the blackberry syrup made and coffee bean creating a slight hint of coffee combined with the smoothness of whole milk is a testament to molecular gastronomy.  I have now come to the conclusion that as long as a craftsmen is true to their craft, I can respect that.  I can not only respect it, I can admire it.  Corona CafÌ© is a true rarity and certainly respects that vibe of coffee coffeeing and blending.   While the green and whites are painting by number, Naimen is a true vibeist. vibe work for sale From the inside... ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The service introduced himself and he seemed to really put a lot of attention and he made sure the drink was made to perfection.

(Normally I get a chlorophyll and green tea coffee with almond milk, but today called for some extra oomph. I was clearly not disappointed.) As he described it, it tastes exactly like gingerbread. I agree, but it's 800x better than any gingerbread I've ever had. He also said, ""It's sometimes just really nice to have the time to make something special for someone."" Can it get better than that? Can it?!  Some other bright seating about Corona: they make a lot of their own flavors from scratch (the blackberry syrup is fantastic, and so is the long-brewed cinnamon/clove tea). (Edit: I previously thought they roast their own beans...someone who doesn't work there told me that! See Naiman's comment below. Does not change my opinion.) I found out today that the condensed milk is handmade. A lot of the food goods are as well. They serve food from Fricano's that are delicious.

I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now, but with this place just a few blocks away from there, I think I found a new morning spot.  They were not too busy, so it was easy to find a seating and there are plenty of internet for you to charge your phones, laptops, and other devices. I definitely would recommend this place and encourage you to GO LOCAL. They close at 3, so Star Bucks may keep my loyalty in the evenings.

I live close by but discovered it by chance when traffic was particularly backed up and I hadn't taken the time to make coffee at home. It's tucked away on a side street off of Cameron Road in a nondescript row of businesses, perfect for the location.  The vibe is wonderful and everyone there is friendly! I talked to the service and two costumers as my order was taken and felt genuinely welcomed. The shop has an authenticity about it that's refreshing.  I've only gotten their coffee coffee (super affordable, flat $2 for a good sized cup) and a tasty almond poppyseed food, but both were worth the price. Based on other vibe's reviews I'd like to try some other drinks rather than my usual coffee coffee. I will definitely be making more coffee pit stops here! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I wasn't really planning on being a fan of this place, but then we parkinged in, loved the vibe and both of us were almost immediately talked into trying the horchata with coffee (which, might I add, didn't take much convincing). The horchata is made in house with almond milk and is the bees knees. Ask for a sample!  Naiman (sp?), the service, is awesome and makes tons of stuff in house from scratch - anything from syrups to horchata! They're the ""Corona"" items on the menu, you'll notice them for the creativity.  So, now that I've been a few times I can definitely say I'm hooked on two things: 1) Horchatte and 2) double coffeeed green tea w/ chlorophyll.  Try them.

This place is really amazing. vibe, Drinks (Best Cold coffee in town, hands down), food, service. All A+++. Family owned and run, this location shop has got your favorite chain beat. Just try it once, you'll be amazed.  vibe: It's hidden in a small strip mall, and if you blink you'll miss it. So, don't blink because its totally worth it.

The noise level is usually pretty quite, with occasional vibes that make it get to the average level, but there always a few vibe working on their laptops so the noise level stays pretty low.  Drinks: So this is where they really shine and what ultimately drew me in as a regular. The cold coffee here is stunning, and it takes a lot to impress me. I've driven all over this town and tried everyone's cold coffee. Then I found Corona, and it changed my life. I know that sounds dramatic, and it is. But it's also true. Talking with the management about their approach to coffee, it becomes quite clear that they take this sh*t seriously! Their knowledge and skills are unparalleled. Other than the cold coffee, they have a whole assortment of gourmet drinks. And I mean, Gour-freaking-met! The Pulsar (caramel coffee with himalayan salt) is my favorite. But the Corona Borealis (Kashmiri green tea chai coffee topped with fresh saffron, parkingdamom and cinnamon) is my other favorite. Freaking Saffron!  food: They parkingry food-Mex foods. The migas is delicious, but the food, cactus and black bean is also very popular. The spicy green salsa is creamy and delicious!  service: They are all so knowledgeable and friendly. This family establishment really parkinges about their vibe and you will see it in the numerous regulars that come and go all day. I always have a great time when I come here.

Hmmm... Let me tell you what this place is not:  1.  It's not your mama's coffeehouse. 2.  It's not food at Tiffany's. 3.  If this is your hood, it could very well be the best part of waking up, without Folgers in your cup.  Second, you need to know the family that runs this place keeps it hours from 7am to 3pm, Monday through Friday. And that's it. This is somewhat unique because:  A) They like spending their time doing family stuff together, rather than increasing business revenue. B)  It's a happy family. You'll know it when you chat with them. C)  I'm not sure how far the ""Family First"" concept flies these days at Wharton.  Yes, it probably gets backed up here during a typical morning rush, and they're always tweaking stuff like menu items and pre-packaged brown bag fare for you to parkingryout quickly. But if you do have a little time, consider stopping in here for a moment or two: I'm simply fascinated with vibe who run a business and do what they do because by gosh and golly, it's exactly what they want to do, and not just another service or something else in life to complain about.  I had originally planned to give Corona CafÌ© four-stars for being what they are - an unexpected gem of a coffeehouse hidden in a strip mall. That in itself makes them special. But it occurred to me, as I was hanging there on a Monday afternoon with an coffee and chatting about families and business and stuff, that this place might actually be an unexpected reality check, a brief respite for a ""stop and smell the roses"" moment. It was obviously more the scent of coffee than roses, of course, but I left there thinking, this just might be as good as it gets. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The building is not the fanciest. You won't find granite fixtures and snooty leather seating.  You will find a business service who is absolutely passionate about coffee and taking parkinge of vibe. I thought I knew a fair bit about coffee until I talked the service. I know nothing, Jon Snow.  That said, coffee is serious business to me. I am crippling my financial future, shorting my retirement, and eliminating a number of bad price private schools from my children's futures because of the amount of money I spend on coffee. Good coffee matters, and, when done well, it can be sublime.  I am heavily biased toward shops that use Cuvee beans (a local vibeisanal treasure and a shining example of what is right in the Austin food scene), so I was skeptical about Corona using different beans. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks at Corona. The beans from Trianon, turned into a delicious rich coffee. The drink was great and a nice change of pace from the Cuvee that I drink almost every day.  To folks in the Mueller / Capital Plaza area, you should be patronizing this shop. If you are getting your daily fix at Starbucks or, gag, McDonalds, then you are making a terrible mistake. Come out and support an underdog and get superior coffee in the process. It's a win win.

They also offer Horchata (yup), hand crafted Kashmir chai, refreshing fruit seltzers (""agua frescas"") and syrups - ALL are made in the store. Like I said, Corona is all about quality drinks.  Arrive hungry as well. There are soups made in store from mama's recipes, made to order sammies, fruit & yogurt parfaits, food foods and pressed foods to name some choices. Always ask what the chef has prepared today.  If it sounds like parking into Corona Cafe will leave you spoiled for choices on good food and great drinks then you are correct.

(A lot of cafes only serve the same old, boring mint and chamomile coffee). They have something called the 'Supernova' which is lemon-lime echinacea (with, I think, blackberry syrup) that is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.  2) This is a family owned and run place, where everyone is super nice.

I believe I was greeted by the service, who was very nice and informed me of their offerings. I came in close to closing time (3PM) and ordered a large iced coffee, unsweetened and no seating for cream (that's how I roll, black as night). It was delicious and I sat down for a bit trying to figure out what the wi-fi password was. Then I remembered I live 5 seconds away and there really was no need to find it out at that moment.  But really, I like this cafÌ© a lot. It's in a strange shopping center right before you enter an older location. In fact, you can find it in the same place as Nomad. No problem parking here, there's also the lot in the back. Always somewhere to sit, since this place is kind of a secret.

I really wanted to like this place since it is local and close by. I never have a decent vibe at this cafÌ© unless the parents are working.  I have gotten food from Corona a few times everything is fine except the food foods. They are never good. The foods always have weird synthetic after taste and are dry. Even salsa can't help those foods.  I brought my visiting family to the cafe 40 minutes before closing. The daughter wasn't flat out rude but needs a little more training in customer service. She asked us if we we're planning on staying to drink our coffee or leaving. We responded we were going to stay and enjoy our coffee. She then proceeded to tell us they were closing soon with that sweet teenage I really want you to leave now face. What she should have done was put our drinks in to go cups and let us sit and enjoy our coffee (mind you the place still had a couple of vibe). I was so frustrated with the service I did not order a drink. My mother and sister were unhappy with their watered down drinks and were disappointed I brought them to Corona Cafe.

And crepes! And it's all available until 3! Yay! I've never been to France, so I can't compare but I thought my crepe was very tasty. I'm excited to come back and try more. It's a little bit backwards in that they bring everything out to you without utensils or fixings and no one mentions where to find such items.

Every time I come here, good quality coffee, crepes, kombucha on tap, and spectacular service, everything really is good here. Nothing pretentious or upscale about this coffee shop as opposed to all the other little places around town. If you're anything like me, appreciate good service and quality, go here before Starbucks. It's the same price if not good priceer and tastes 1000x better. Ps, the blonde service with the blue eyes is the nicest one I have met so far, they are all nice!

I came via Uber and parkinged back to my Airbnb - note there are some sidewalks on roads and some without so pedestrian minded folks beware!! The vibee is quint and colorful, a collection of nic-nacs surround the walls and bookshelf in the front seating. The shop is vibe expansive and bathrooms are in the very back. There's plenty of seating between lounge seating and couches to standard seatings and seating.  I ordered a Mediterranean/Tuscan crepe with a iced coffee. The crepe was warm and full of even parts tomato, food and meat. Tasted fine but nothing special. The Vietnamese coffee over ice woke me right up and was full body sweetened, intense coffee flavor. Definitely worth the price but overall the cost of most things are average for the area. service were nice and the vibe was comfy, soft vibe playing in the background.

My coffee, however, was a Huge letdown.. the temperature was too high and it was burnt, so burnt that I couldn't even finish half. My friend's iced coffee, however, was pretty good.  This cafe also service food, which means that if you stay there for long enough, you parking out smelling like food rather than coffee..

It was delicious and completely refreshing (especially for those hot summer days in Austin). On the other hand, the Saigon was the opposite in which it was an explosion of rich, savorful flavors. Still delicious.  The establishment gives off a studious college vibe. There are scattered seatings perfect for diners/studiers of 1, 2, or a mild sized group. It was vibe when we went (around food time) with diners on their laptops, studying from their books, and sipping on their coffee. Besides crepes, the establishment also offers food goods, which we have yet to try.  Warning: they stop service crepes around a certain time (2 pm?).

The service is usually super nice and friendly, and space is super nice and comfortable.  The only reason for a 4-star review is because of the ""hiccups"" I've hit when ordering something made hot/fresh. In the past, I put in an order for some food food, only to be told that the chef wasn't yet in to do it. This was, admittedly, my fault since I pretty much came a few minutes after hoursing. I decided to give it another shot a few weeks later, and was disappointed by my food and food food food food. The food was burnt and the food was very stale. I'm not sure if I was just doubly-unlucky, but I'd like to think others would have a better vibe with ordering cooked-to-order items from here.

The service was helpful and courteous, and the vibe was vibe, with some vibe working on computers, and others socializing vibely, or reading books.

Service is excellent and it's a big place with lots of seating. That being said, the food is highly bad price and mediocre. A food with food and food will run you $7.50 (their menu says $6.50). It was completely smothered in greasy food. Nothing local or local or fancy for that high dollar ticket. For two foods, the food and a couple coffee we price $24. You can have a lovely sit down food at other places in Austin for the same price as this place. This would be a good place to work as the dining seating was almost empty, but I would skip the food.

This is a great study spot and is far enough from location that it is not packed with students. The red couch eats you up once you sit down. Traps you there for optimal productivity.

In the morning get there early and enjoy the food foods before the building service take advantage of this first floor coffee stop. Enjoy your morning greeting from Sam who provides that special touch transforming your morning cup of coffee to a delightful coffee vibe. Never have I described coffee the way I describe alcohol. This is an amazing stop and deserves to be shared and enjoyed. Take a parking over to the corner of 6th and Congress- enter into the mezzanine at the Bank of America building on the corner- put the Starbucks to your back and enjoy a coffee by Sam.

The Wintermoon (iced summermoon) is the best coffee I've ever had. I can't even-  I loved it so much that I seriously considered doubling back and getting another one in the same cup after I finished it (refill style). I've never felt that way about a coffee beverage before. I like that it's not like a big chain and it's in a very corporate-feeling building. It's kind of like a small act of resistance to shop local while surrounded by such huge businesses. Anyway- if I'm location, this is the place I'd want to go. Despite being a gold status Starbucks parkingdholder/addict?  Friendly but not in that overwhelmingly-perky way (which, let's be real, too much perk is tricky when I've had too little coffee on a Monday). I'd definitely come back and recommend to friends.

There, sits Brian's proudly service all the ticky -tackies (and they all look just the same)  I grabbed a double coffee and while I was disappointed that there was no demitasse, the product itself did not disappoint.  It was a smooth shot, reminiscent of an Italian coffee.  I think I actually got to speak with Brian or maybe he has a worker who looks just like the guy in the illustration.  He told me about how they choose a medium roast for their coffee and they feel the wood fire roasting is what develops the smoothness of the shot.  Clearly, they are also pulling it properly because as any coffee snob knows, even the greatest beans can be destroyed by poor technique.

Before I ordered, I asked what the Summermoon tasted like, and was told something like ""pure deliciousness"" or ""pure awesomeness"".  It's a bit of a hard sell...how often do you buy something to eat when the vibe making it cannot tell you what it tastes like.  When he said it was the top seller, I decided to take the plunge.  Then it took a few minutes to mix up the milk in the back seating, and I was told ""sorry, need to make more unicorn tears"" or somesuch.

The coffee was delicious! So smooth, and even though it was the 1/2 sweet one, it was plenty sweet for me. I'm anxious to try the coffee coffee, and I saw some coffee in mason jars... did I hear him say those were cold coffeeed? That might be good to take home to have on the weekends.

Talk about a drink with multiple layers of flavor: slightly sweet, creamy, and a tad savory. Like woaaaaaaaa!

It is very good locationly location behind this famous eating spot.  And even if you're not around for meat, the coffee is worth stopping all on it's own.  The deluxe coffee is lightly sweet almost like a hot chocolate which I vibeally liked.  The Cassandra (a honey cinnamon coffee) is actually surprisingly nutty which I also enjoyed.

Each one has such vibeality - some are air streamers, some are buses, some look like little houses on wheels. The only thing they have in common is that they are on wheels and that they are uniquely vibeated to the whim of the service of the truck. I love that.  Legend Coffee, is no exception. parkinged behind Franklin BBQ on an unpaved yard, is this tiny little house on wheels. It's made entirely of wooden slats, complete with a 3 tiered roof, and a tiny cut out window where the service works gracefully as if this were her own home.  The vibe in Austin do not rush you. They let you take your time, examine all the different types of beverages they offer, before gently nudging you to order. There probably isn't a huge line in front of you and probably not a huge line behind you. And, if there is, vibe are quite chilled out about it. I think that affects how a beverage is made. Because the coffee that I ordered was one of the most delicious coffee drinks I've ever had.  The Queen Bee coffee piqued my interest, an coffee with steamed milk, honey, and coconut oil. I've never had coconut oil in my coffee before, but let me tell you, it was delicious. It smelled better than any coffee I've ever had. Coffee with honey and milk you can probably imagine, but the full bodied finish of coconut oil in the end, that just give it a third texture, smell, and dimension that I didn't expect but ended up savoring. I highly recommend it and wish I had a cup right now. today's specials Legend Coffee's adorable food truck house longhorn ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

They have fancy things like a cayenne cinnamon hot chocolate, different daily food goods and bags of coffee beans, but the regular hand poured coffee was spectacular!  They use an Ethiopian roast that smells intoxicating, especially in the cold. Have it black, or visit the seating a few steps away for cream and syrup (in a bourbon bottle, I like their style).

Also got a scone once before the food ran out, and I look forward to more of those as well. Not too sweet either, which I like.

It's actually a food truck not a coffee shop. Their coffee is subtle, not too sweet. I tried their Mucho Mint coffee and their Cassandra. Both of them were warm drinks. Both of them were not too sweet and subtle. So if you like your drinks sweet, I would add some extra sugar. The Cassandra is a honey, cinnamon coffee which was nice. They only have one size and they were about $5 each. They run out of food pretty quickly since a lot of vibe get to Franklin BBQ really early so if you're planning on grabbing a quick bite, I would stop by somewhere else on the way or parking to some nearby food trucks or coffee shops.

The coffee tastes like it is coffeeed in a loaf of rye food, which I love but not in a hot cup of coffee.  Maybe they are trying to ride out the current beard loving,  whiskey drinking, lumber sexual trend. vibeally, when I want coffee, rye whiskey is not the flavor profile I am craving.  The Columbia coffee was harsh in all the wrong places.

The services are really nice charming vibe, knowledgeable and passionate about their food, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their food as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety food that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I vibeally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream food is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the foodcake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean foodcake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).

I mainly came here to try their food donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla food on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the vibe, but the taste of it was only decent. The food filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular food selections.  My mom and older brother both got food cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their foodcake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach food. coffee is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up!

Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia food does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing vibe playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support.

I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the food was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out!

I thought it was very good & the service looked very nice.  Cherry foodcake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream food but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most vibe.  This is a good, safe place to get food.

Most of them don't offer what I consider real food. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome vibe (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome food too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.

Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate food (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  service and the service are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it!

We tried a few samples of flavors including foodcake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.

The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia service up various flavors of handmade food and coffee. I stuck with the food this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small food gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the foodcake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The food was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.

We love to see vibe passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are hours late too so perfect for after food!

This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had food everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical food flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry foodcake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry foodcake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me).

I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.

But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best food I have ever had.  Venezia is location off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon parking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The services are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole vibe that much better. The wife took parkinge of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit food. No regrets there.  The vibe inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the services said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The food was fantastic but the vibe was even better.  I want this place to stay hours for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian service added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the food.

Since there were couple of vibe so they male guy took over the service. As my turn arrived .. He was rude and said u can only try 2 flavors.. That's ok. He just gave me both the flavors in one spoon to taste and asked me to hold the spoon. And even told my friend u decide n keep what u want. I understand there were 2 couple behind me but that doesn't mean he would ignore us y don't know. I requested him for trying a new flavor but he said its ""Rule they would only give 2.

Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the foodcake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the food is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather price $4 for a delicious food here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the food here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia food. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic food on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better food in seatingtle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality food frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my foods and cream. Not to mention Italian true coffee to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The vibe was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for food or after food. Bravo!

I think there is better food to be had in Austin.  The vibe was quaint and clean in a modern-Venetian style.  Oddities: 1) Your two samples (limit) are put on the same tiny spoon, so one will affect the flavor of the other. 2) Arriving just after hoursing, I was surprised to sit at sticky seating. 3) There are only six regular parking spaces and nowhere to parking on busy Lamar Blvd. (There might be three more available after business hours at the place next door.) 4) Their website food policy is in Italian legalese and literally-translated English, which is unintelligible.

After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go coffee, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of vibe of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing vibe with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for vibe looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice seating in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait service, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me.

I tried to strike up a conversation and got 1-word answers. The service and other service interactions were the same. They were very friendly to some vibe that appeared to be regulars so maybe it was just me.

I ordered a simple coffee, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small seatings. Their coffee has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.

I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first hoursed they used to make food and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be hours until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be hours 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The vibe. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The service often have the vibe BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the vibe in front of you.

Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".   Very disappointed with the service on this most recent visit, but at least the coffee drinks were great as always; just embarrassing to ""show off"" my favorite coffee place to out of town friends and get this type of visit.

The coffee and service are great, but cleanliness and vibe are lacking.  My favorite is the cold coffee coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their coffee is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the food are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that service up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and food.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside seating when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.

They guys have a pretty bad price machine to pull coffee, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.

The service is friendly, kind, and  quick, the vibe is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF food, and even though sometimes it gets so vibeed I've parkinged in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is seating at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere.

I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The vibe is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the service. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The vibe selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display vibe and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few vibe are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great vibe, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend.

Yes, the vibe selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.

I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original price were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store hours for years to experiment with. Also, my usual coffee had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except coffee, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated price, for reference:  coffee: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) coffee: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) coffee: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) coffee: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to price a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better.

I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's food, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly service who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel vibeality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine coffee's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo vibe, or the Anderson Lane food-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost vibely epic.

Keep in mind I drink black coffee. I hate anything in my coffee, so if you're looking for coffee or coffee, my review probably won't help you.  My iced and hot coffee were disgusting every time I ordered them. They looked like dirty water, and tasted worse. I tried the iced coffee thinking maybe I'd just stay away from the coffee. It's not much better. For some reason both the coffee and iced coffee have a horribly bitter/I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-it taste. It's not a flavor in coffee with which I'm familiar. And I've worked in two coffee shops and been drinking coffee since long before I should have started.  I'll admit that while I do appreciate certain coffee more than others, I'm able to appreciate/stand pretty much any coffee, anywhere. I had to throw out my almost-full iced coffee, and the others I drank more of basically because I was there with a friend, I paid for them, and I knew that they weren't going to make them any better. But I didn't finish any of them.  I'll also agree on the comments about the attitudes of the service. I often feel like I'm an inconvenience to them.  The only reason I keep coming here is because I meet a friend about once a week, and she likes this place (for the mojos) and it's a good in-between meet-up. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to request a new meeting place.  If you're in the mood for tea, however, go for it. Even if you're not...go for it. ", 1.0 star rating ,1,LOW

Russell's food's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why vibe are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell food (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hoursly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a coffee & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvÌ©e that is used for coffee. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy coffee, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the service will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has parkinged in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the service, who is kinda vibe, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of vibe. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the vibe is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good seating in the back. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

It was old-timey country at first, but abruptly turned 80s alternative. The first song in that sequence was Buffalo Bob's transvestite song in ""Silence of the Lambs."" This is more of a place for vibe in their 30s or 40s.  First off, this is in a really cool little area. It's right next to Alamo Drafthouse on Anderson (which also means that parking is hopeless). It's part of a community of businesses centered around this leafy garden thing.  It's small, but not comfy. vibe is poor, but vibe seem to be studying here with some success.

Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is CuvÌ©e in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the service members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they parkinge about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a vibe instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve CuvÌ©e coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally location to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the service said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same service parkings to our seating with a slice of foodcake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of foodcake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

What the F is a coffee? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, hours 24 hours coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not hours 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to location. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside seating is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space.

This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy coffee was so delicious- really really good coffee, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- coffee syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.)

I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent vibe, vibe on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the piÌ¬ce de rÌ©sistance) the incredible Strada coffee machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club food.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the vibe there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great vibe, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are seatings, benches, sofas, comfy seating, plentiful internet...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the service and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y coffee so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a food unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.

You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to food on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli.

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their vibe to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha coffee and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so vibe, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  price are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super good price, but not too bad price.

I didn't know that until I saw the alcohol taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the location - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying hours until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those food & foods, and their colorful matcha-infused coffee. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave.

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable seating). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, internet  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow vibe (the background vibe can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one parkinges. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the seating in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The vibe is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink price are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as food and foods.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The service do a good service maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffee, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of vibe, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Pros: vibe seatinging vibe General vibe Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively bad price Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the vibe, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine coffee down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the vibesy/design vibe having a collaborative meeting.)  The service is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no internet to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of vibe?  seatinging is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella food ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The food is a great idea but the food itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the food crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The food itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a coffee and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

We wanted to try their delicious looking foods and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to coffee.  We both ordered the Nutella food and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous vibe and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The food is basically half a food, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The food itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the food. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella food and a fried food food. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other foods, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger vibe and there is definitely no place for high seating. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of seating games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have food with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!

It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated price and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general vibe of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the food and foods and I ordered Nutella foods with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my food still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed.

It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella food, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No internet yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute vibe (props to the designer), but vibe is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed vibe of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay hours till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a alcohol/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.

Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the seating and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude vibe inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful vibe.

After trying it for ourselves, I have to admit they do serve excellent coffee; my tasty iced coffee was very well made. My husband's chai coffee was delicious and among the best we've had in the city.  That being said, I found myself a bit shocked when I looked at the bill; the coffee cup size was smaller than what I usually get at other third wave coffee shops, yet the cost was at least a dollar more bad price. Yes, the coffee is good, but is it THAT good? My wallet isn't so sure!  Another point that left me disappointed was the food; not only was the selection very limited, but upon asking if the service could reheat my food, he reply they couldn't as they do not have a microwave and that they probably never will have one as they fear vibe would ask them to use it to reheat their coffee. Hum, what?  No, I don't want you to put my food (or cold coffee for that matter) in the microwave. That's disgusting. I would think however it would be a really smart idea to invest in a mini oven used to bake fresh parties or simply reheat them for 30 seconds. My food was cold and a bit lifeless. This problem could so easily be fixed! The way I see it, if you're going to do food, do it right or not at all, especially with the high price you are asking your vibe to price!  Will I be back? I don't know. I'm kind of thrown off by the attitude and price. That being said, Houndstooth does have great coffee and deserves its fame in that department. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Mad props to Scotty G for the introduction!  I was in caffeinated, coffee heaven! There were so many amazing choices and I can only imagine each one is done well!  I had Japanese cold coffee, which half the fun is watching it be made. My friend had the the parkingbonated tea, which tasted just like it smelled, dreamy! He also go their signature lil coffee cocktail the ""Jo and Jam"" that was so darn adorable, I didn't want him to drink it!  Watching the service flutter about behind the bar was like watching dancing butterflies and each and every one of them were so nice, approachable and *gasp* talkative!  It was pretty vibeed on Sunday afternoon, so we stood at the bar and enjoyed the show. The vibe here was an eclectic mix of everybody and seemed to be a hodgepodge of regulars and newbs. I am not going to lie...pretty much everyone in the place was easy on the eyes.  I will definitely be back to peruse more of their coffee offerings, enjoy the eye candy, and hopefully take advantage of one of their Monday coffee tastings!

To read the one hang-up please scroll to the end. We both got coffee. The wait time was good, the service are visible and engaging, and you can really tell this is their craft. They love making coffee, and it shows. The aroma when you parking in is delicious and our drinks raised our eyebrows. Even though it was busy we had no problem finding a seating. We were in there about 90 minutes and the line was never shorter than 5 vibe. I do think they should have a visible menu though.  My one dismay was the cost. We got a 12oz coffee and a 16oz coffee and it was TWELVE DOLLARS. Twelve dollars!!!!!!! By far the most bad price coffee we've ever had, but they had hundreds of vibe lined up so it doesn't seem to deter vibe.

For a long time I've heard Houndstooth has great coffee, so this morning as I needed a cup while perusing the paper I thought, why not? Well, here's why not.  In fairness, I've only had one vibe here, but it didn't make me want to come back. Maybe you will fare better.  The good: its a relatively low-key place - I don't remember any weird vibe wafting over the speakers as some places do. I was greeted as soon as I came in, there is ample seating including a comfy love seating and some cushioned seating as well as the range of high tops seatings and bar stools and, as a plus, a long community seating seating maybe a dozen friends, family or maybe strangers-about-to-be friends. Every coffee shop should have one of these! And don't forget cleanliness - you and I have been to coffee shops where you're afraid to touch anything much less drink or eat, but Houndstooth isn't like that, at least not the one on North Lamar across from Central Market. It is clean and orderly with a nice mid-century modern chic.  Wow Chris, sounds like you like this place. Why only two stars? Okay, here's the downside.  I asked for a cup of bold rich coffee - there were several choices and I like to listen to the service's advice. Although I could see several of the beans listed in front of me my service said, oh, that would be our house blend. House blend? Okay, I'll give it a shot... The house blend was served almost hot (not hot enough Houndstooth) and was not memorable. Better than average? Sure. Anywhere near Thunderbird's? No, not in the same galaxy. Fuggetaboutit.  The food I order was small - close to junior - and was hard. As in not fresh. While I don't eat foods often when I do I want a real one, sizable and fresh. Houndstooth was neither. I sometimes will pop an old food into the microwave to take the edge of the staleness but you really shouldn't have to. This one was just forgettable. My drink - a normal-sized mug - appeared on the bar but I never heard the service call it out even though the comfy love seating I camped on was six feet away. Weird. Through-out my visit I noticed the service called out all the drinks without volume or enthusiasm, so, if you happened to be somewhere else I'm not sure how you would hear him.  The cup and food, neither of which was large, set me bak $6. A little coffee for mediocrity my friends.  Was not clear where to put my used dish and mug when I was down so I laid it on the corner of the bar with the consent of the service, but even he didn't seem to know where to put it. I never saw anyone come out from behind the bar bussing the floor so its not clear to me how things get back to the kitchen.  All in all, not bad - definitely not one-star - but just no real reason ever to go back. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

I've only been to the Lamar location, but I really like it!  As for the beverages,  they definitely take their craft seriously at Houndstooth and have several 'daily coffee' to choose from. I think Houndstooth has some of the most talented service in Austin. Not a place to go if you're looking for something similar to Starbucks' sugary, fake coffee beverage; this is the real deal.  I haven't quite decided if the great bitter taste that I love about Houndstooth is worth the hefty price associated with their drinks. I do really love their coffee, and would prefer it over a lot of other places in Austin, but the price deters me from visiting often.  Also, if you don't prefer the rich coffee taste, I wouldn't come here. I took my sister here who is less favorable with the bitter taste and she had to add quite a bit of sugar to her drink in order to tolerate it.

When a place doesn't have parkingamel, I opt for vanilla and cinnamon. But houndstooth had vanilla and honey so that's what I ordered. Because I love honey and I'm trying to stop myself from adding syrup or sugar to my coffee after receiving it.  Sweet enough to satisfy me while still letting the coffee flavor (the bitterness) to seep through.  Not enough internet so that's why I'm docking a star. If I could, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars because of lack of seating as well. Coffee is a solid 4-5 stars. For some reason, all the internet are in the back corner of the place, which doesn't make sense considering there's a huge AF seating for community seating at the front, but with no internet around it.

I messaged the business through their pricement system and received a response, but it doesn't appear that the issue has actually been addressed. This used to be our favorite coffee place in town.  But the quality of the coffee has declined sharply in the past few months.  After yet another undrinkable coffee this morning, I feel like I have to change my previous 5 star review.  The coffee have been coming out with inconsistent coffee shots, and burning hot milk with no texture.   It's a bummer, because we've been coming here forever and the service are all lovely, but I can't recommend the coffee here anymore. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

My friend and I always come here after we finish our food at fooddeli (next door, check it out!!!!). It's always packed and not exactly a super large shop, so I wouldn't come here to study. It has kind of a hipster vibe cuz on the wall it says ""the pattern of coffee and vibe"", there's a big shiny fancy machine, and the (very nice) service always dress hipster and have big glasses/mustaches.

I watched her joke and laugh along with the girl in front of me, who mentioned she was a 6:30am regular.  Half asleep, I waited at the front while she filled their order, and she kindly asked me what she could get started for me. As I was answering, the man behind me said ""one vanilla coffee..oh sorry, didn't see her there."" I rolled my eyes at him as he looked up from his phone. I now had resting bitch face. She replied, seeing my frustration ""I'm sorry, I will get your order in just a minute"" then turning to me ""what would you like?"" I knew before I even answered that this wasn't going to work out. I'm just not the right fit. But I didn't parkinge, none of my regular seating were on my way this morning, Starbucks was hours, and I was running late.  So I halfheartedly asked her what flavored syrups they have for their coffee. She kind of trailed off ""vanilla...honey...."" Luckily, that was just fine. Honey is what I wanted. So I paid for my honey coffee to go, remarking ""oh that is so pretty"" when she brought me my drink and tipping her. But I didn't get a smile or a laugh. My resting b* face cost me my morning greeting.  Its not Houndstooth's fault that I found the dude behind me to be a d*. Nor is it their fault that my usual haunts just weren't good location enough for me today. If I had had more of a pleasant vibe coming in today, I would have excused the fact that I paid a little more for a small coffee. I will say that as hesitant as she was with the flavors, the honey is spot on. Creamy and rich with just that hint of sweetness.

If you have no life, like to blow your money and have eternity to spend in line, this is the place for you.  I was in the area, and saw Houndstooth-- looked it up on yelp and with high ratings I figured I would give it a try!

There were about 5 vibe in line (it was 10:00am when I parkinged in), not too bad for a Thursday morning and figured it would move quickly. Pull some shots, pour some milk, next vibe... right? (I've been a service at a nice coffee shop, I know how to hustle behind the counter). Well, WRONG. These service have NO REGARDS for their vibe time. I couldn't figure out what was taking so long, I price 20 minutes before I got to the front of the line. There were only FIVE vibe ahead of me.... how does it take 20 minutes?? I'm so annoyed.  Now here's the kicker. I ordered an Iced coffee. No size options were asked, so figured they had a standard 12- 14oz cup. I paid $5.50 for the coffee (ridiculous) and added a buck for tip. When I got my coffee, it was teeny. Maybe a 10 oz cup? Which half was filled with ice. So for $6.50 I got about 4 oz of liquid. MEDIOCRE liquid.  Moral of the story- GO TO STARBUCKS.

Never once have I regretted shelling over my precious monies to Houndstooth. It has been worth it every single time.

My vibe with Houndstooth was in the evening. The service/manager was so sweet and talked about all the different coffee they offered, explaining the coffeeing process with great detail.  This tells me they are passionate about a good cup of coffee and that speaks to this coffee lover.  I went to Houndstooth for an after-dinner coffee vibe and it was the perfect setting. If we wanted a fast-food type coffee run with yelling service, paper cups and our names spelled wrong, we would've gone to Starbucks, but we weren't looking for that type of vibe.  We wanted to take our time, talk, drink from a real ceramic cup, and enjoy our adult time away from the kids.  The vibe was great, the vibe was calm, mature, and peaceful.  I saw a few patrons enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a book; it's a great place for that.    We can't wait to return on another date night. the perfect coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

This place never fails to impress me. My cappacino was topped off with an adorable heart in the foam. The only issue I have is that the service size of these cups of perfection are tiny.

FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla coffee, and I really, really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency, and the coffee + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of food if you're hungry, but honestly, the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had.  AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow, wonderful, wonderful, and wonderful. The service were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter, the two service were always working: wiping seatings, sweeping the floors, cleaning the coffee machine, etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly, and made the whole vibe more enjoyable.  The vibe is very vibe. This is a pretty small coffee shop, but full of soft light and is very vibe. Plenty of internet along the walls, so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive.  PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately, quite a few of the parking seating are designated ""10 minutes"" or ""30 minutes"", but there should still be plenty of seating remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeehop that wasn't limited to street parking at all.  COME AGAIN?: Yes, absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done, this is definitely the place I would go. However, I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little vibe for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well.

They were offering Counter Culture and Tweed coffee the morning my wife and I went in. I was disappointed that the only coffee offering was a blend. We ordered two pour overs: the Konga and Idido--both single origin coffee from Counter Culture. Definitely bad price for the size--almost $5 for a 16oz and they were not filled up all the way. I'm a snob, so I'll just say that both drinks were a little diluted (I've coffeeed a bag of the Idido at home so I know what it's supposed to taste like). Still very good coffee though.

Their coffee costs twice as much as Starbucks. I know Starbucks is mega-corporate non-artisinal stuff and there's better to be had, but their ubiquity sets a standard, and in my opinion, if you charge 2x as much for a standard commodity (which is hours less than a block away) you should produce something significantly better than that standard. Houndstooth... well call me an uncultured swine, but in my opinion it isn't that much better, and sometimes it's worse. And I'm talking about coffee, not coffee coffee... I'm not *that* much of an uncultured swine.  But besides Starbucks we could compare it to Kick-butt or Epoch ... both of those places have good priceer, better coffee and in my opinion a better vibe as well.  Houndstooth is constantly vibeed and loud, their wi-fi is mediocre, and I don't know if there's a single plug to recharge. If you like you can sit out on the porch and listen to traffic sounds on Lamar while you chat instead of coffee shop sounds inside, but either way it doesn't strike me as having a single good spot to have the type of vibeal, casual conversation you'd like at a trendy coffee shop.. or even to work remotely, for that matter. (Although the MacBooks abound here--I'm actually on a MacBook, here, as I type this review.)  If it's important for you to get extra-interesting things like pourovers or coffee-cherry tea, novel imports or ""Chemex"" whatever that is, and you get it to go, maybe this can be worth the trouble and expense to you.

The service are knowledgable such that if you present what kind of flavor you're looking for, they may suggest a certain roast for the drink you desire.  Over the past weekend's visit, I've tasted both its iced coffee and a coffee. Great stuff. The service there even suggested me to visit Figure-8 coffee in East Austin. Another great place.

So, after looking at the reviews, I headed over to Houndstooth on the first day of a four day stay in Austin and ended up going back every day.  The pourover is done with a Clever filter which is a bit different than using a Chemex. Rather than pouring the water over and letting the coffee coffee into the parkingafe, the water is coffeeed in the coffee grounds in the Clever. When it's done, the coffee then drains into a glass jar and then poured into the coffee cup. In my opinion, the coffee is a bit more robust than a simple pourover done with a Chemex  What Houndstooth does well is finding great coffee beans from some of the best roasters in the US - Counterculture, PT's, etc. I enjoyed some Amore de Dios (the love of God in Spanish) from CC and it was nothing short of amazing.  The only downside to Houndstooth are the food. We tried a couple of scones on the first day and they were just ok.

The service have been consistently pleasant from my morning vibes, the rotating coffee specials are always great picks and yummy flavors, and they have a great house coffee. They DO offer coffees, but this isn't really the place for those. Their price are a little bit higher than some of the other places in town but I think the tastes are by far better.  Rotating coffee specials are on the left when approaching the register and their major notes are listed to make choosing easier. Same with coffee, which are served with a small glass of (I think) Topo Chico for cleansing the palette, according to my friend Helen.  It's definitely different from other ""coffeeshops"" in that I'm not sure I feel too comfortable studying here for extended periods of time--the word I would describe it with isn't exactly ""cozy.""  Warm even? No. Enjoyable and modern, but in the tiniest bit I'd compare it to Medici in terms of feel seatings and seating-wise.

It's always hard to find parking here and the coffee shop is too small in my opinion--it probably seating a max of 25 vibe. It's a chore in itself to find a seating unless you like sitting outside during the wintertime. On another note, I've always felt awkward staying here as you could easily spot me from the vibe of hipsters at this place.  vibe come here for the coffee as the service know what they are doing but I also go to coffee shops to get work done and sadly the availability of electrical sockets at this place is zilch.

Hand picked Colombian coffee house roasted and freshly ground vs instant coffee tastes basically the same to me. As a result I basically like my coffee 10% coffee, 40% milk, and 50% sugar. Therefore, I normally just drown any coffee given to me in copious amounts of sugar, honey, and sweetener (yay diabeetus).  BUT my vibe at houndstooth was mucho different-o. I ordered a vanilla coffee with Rustico coffee (i have no idea what that is but the friendly service recommended it). Just as I was about to nuke it with sugar, I decided to give it a sip first. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM much taste, such good! Didn't even need sugar. I believe that's truly a testament to the quality of Houndstooth coffee. So far its the best quality coffee I have tried in Austin!  Other notes: This place is very vibe, but its a downright terrible place if you want to get work done. It's quite loud, has like zero internet, and very few actual seatings. Come here to chat and enjoy good coffee. Don't bother trying to study!  Overall: I loved the coffee, but I probably won't be a regular. $5.10 for a small cup of coffee is to luxurious for a poor college student D: ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

In my case I asked for a coffee, but I am sure they are perfect with every other coffee you can ask for. Even that I took my sweet time, they didn't want to hurry me as coffee takes it time and to choose the right one also can take a minute or two. You never want to go for the wrong one. The place itself has different seatings and such and I sat down at a bar type seating. The comfy ones were already taken and I didn't want to re-seat.  On a side note, they have some water ready to get it yourself, and reusable water cups, I like that.

There's also free parking which is a major plus. Medici is a fancy coffeehouse with modern furniture. In the middle of the coffeehouse is where the counter where the coffee machine is location and you can order your drinks. You have to go to the left part of the counter and you pick up your drink at the opposite counter. There are couches you can sit, tall seatings, and there's outside seating sitting.

My wife and I are avid coffee drinkers, drinking coffee two to three times a day.  We just moved into Lamar Union, the apartment building that this coffee shop is in and I was excited about having this place within quick parking distance!  You know, wake up and grab a coffee or come home from work and grab one, or hell drink them all day when I work from home a couple times a week.    Unfortunately for me, my first and last vibe at this location made it so I will not come back. Not only that, but I don't think I will be going to their other locations either.  There are a lot of options in Austin and if I have to drive to get to another shop like Irie Bean or Patika on Lamar then I will.  I parkinged into the store before work one day and asked for some black coffee with seating.  I indicated I wanted one of the central American roasts and the service said it would take five minutes to make that order happen.  I was not upset by this at all, sometimes that happens.  So, I changed my order to an coffee with 3 shots and thats when things when wrong.    He informed me that they just could not possibly ever do that.. because their machine pours two at once.  I had a choice of two or four.  I asked if he could.. split the shot.. maybe pour half the second shot in and I would price for four.  But noooo, they do not do that... their policy is two or four.  This being early in the morning and me having married a woman that was a service all the way through college and someone that drinks coffee two to three times a day, told him politely I would find somewhere else to go.  So, I left and found a shop that would be willing to do what I asked with my drink that I am priceing for.  Doesn't seem like a big deal and it isn't really in day to day life. However, with so many other quality places I do not have time to deal with coffee snobs who are unwilling to let me drink what I want if I am not asking for something insane.

They don't need to have so many shops, in so many locations that necessitate high real estate premiums... yet they want to provide a common space for friends and family to gather in high-traffic areas in the city of Austin.  My friend and I considered their revenue-cost ratio and figured that this local institution could bankroll with one shop, charging a lot more in one location in which all of their efforts are directed. If you think about it, the coffee price haven't changed much over the years... sometimes keeping things simple create the most convenience for the vibe in charge.

If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Flitch and Fleet are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you parkinge? Trust Ms Foster's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Flitch was out right before a Sunday closing, and I only had remnants from a late Tuesday morning one. But I did think my $2.50 coffee was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of a Spartan & seatings, it's easy to parking, and this area of Tillery street may be the last non-gentrified oasis in East Austin - hey, isn't that Jake Crane the Coffeedog? Flitch takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. Flitch is location just south of the Tillery St Plant Co, where I thought it was going to be for some inexplicable reason. 3-4 vibe can sit inside the renovated Spartan, but think outside picnic seatings if you're planning to hang.

Misplaced next to an old gray cottage, with piles of fresh lumber stacked on metal seatings, acting as sculpture, in this big concrete lot a quite serene tree shaded seating in the corner provided a sound meditative space for coffee and chat, as roosters crowed, ducks quacked in nearby neighbors yards, while soft sounds of construction parlayed in the back ground of this rapidly growing east austin location.  ""We're the only coffee shop this side of Pleasant Valley"", the poised pale and pretty smiling Chicago gal that wo-mans this trailer informed me as she poured my triple coffee in her simple but woodsy vibe outfitted metal trailer.  I scored a strawberry pop tart from Luckys and found a cinder block to perch on for a cigarette away from the communal seating as locusts churred and birds chirped, and I sipped on a bright, acidic coffee that didn't quit taste like the full rich body of coffee but rather an excellently coffeeed coffee revealing a tasty bean.  The remoteness of the spot is in fact one of its high points, so come grab an easy cup from this 3 month young coffee trailer if you want to escape the brouhaha of funky east side.

I wanted to jump seeing they offer STEVIA along with cane sugar, and brown sugar!!!! First coffee shop I have been to so far that has STEVIA option!!!!! They don't put any kind of sweetener in the coffee, so I can adjust the sweet level to my liking!! Another huge point!!!  Little things matter a lot and always add up y'all!!!! They just made my night with great coffee, STEVIA, again, and the cutest/best touch complimentary tiny food that comes on the side with the coffee!!! It's delicious too!!!!  parking is a lil pain in the ass, but just do location parking, don't parking in any of the Laundry's parking seating next door or your parking will get towed. seatinging and coffee are definitely worth the little trouble!!!!

Everyone around me seemed to be enthralled in their work as well (they may be checking Fb but looked real professional even so), so it's conducive to work.  This location is unique in that it's definitely Austin-y, but without going overboard (remember those uncomfortable but cool-looking furniture from that one shop? Or two?) So why only 4 stars?

Maybe I'm just spoiled or I expect too much, but I like to have a little friendly exchange and not just parking up and bark my order at someone.

Unfortunately, the only bags they had were too large, but the service happily hoursed one and made me a smaller, 16 oz bag. He then gave us one of our coffee for free, and also ground the beans for me (I have a hand-grinder at home, so that can be pretty tedious).  Didn't even mention their coffee, but it is INCREDIBLE.

You know what, I'm going to take a star away due to how uncomfortable I felt hovering by someone's seating while I was standing in line. There really is no good way to stand in a line of 4 or more vibe considering how congested this spot can get (remember, best coffee within 6 months of coffee brain history).

Not love, but liked. parking was a pain but once I got inside the interior is pleasant and warm, even if the vibe isn't my vibeal preference. I ordered an iced almond milk coffee (the same drink I get at every single coffee shop I go to for the first time, to gauge then against each other) and it was alright. I liked their crushed iced and the almond milk was nice and creamy, although I wish the coffee would have come through a bit stronger - I could've used an extra shot. The vibe was nice, as its in a renovated old home, making it feel very welcoming. My two biggest reasons it didn't get 4 stars: the vibe they were playing happened to be a fiddler or some type of instrument that, without even being particularly loud, seemed to cut through my headphones no matter how loud I turned my own vibe. Didn't love that. Secondly, I thought that the $5.10 price for my coffee was a bit coffee- I get it, it's Austin, but I've had better almond milk coffee for slightly good priceer elsewhere. Even knocking 25å¢ off would've made it seem more reasonable & comparable. Overall, I'd come again if I was in the area and wanted some coffee. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

It's easy to get to (as opposed to having to find street parking location or near location), and has such a different feel than the others. Less students than the location location, more residential locals, but all locations are pretty laidback.  This is the only location without two stories, but the pro of this one is the quaint seating on stone furniture in the front and the small seating space with a doggie bowl. The space is a repurposed home (well... you're in Austin) with great internet, a great mixed vibe, closely spaced seatings, and a feel of a friend's home or the location coffeehop.  Even though this location has a lot, it's fairly small and often a time I've had to find parking elsewhere and parking over. This particular location is in a pretty hip part of that location, and there's always vibe biking by or parking their dogs outside. Oh yeah, the coffee is great too, and the service friendly.

First off, the coffee is DELICIOUS...but product isn't enough....    With tons of awesome coffee shops and roasters in town, it's gotta be more than just a nice cup of coffee.    The thing that turned me from a fan to ""never going back"" the attitude from snarling barrister girl on my recent visit (probably my 20th this year).    Here's what happened:  When she was taking my order for a soy coffee, (the same thing I order every time), she was on the phone and not priceing much attention.  When she started making my drink I looked over and saw her using regular milk.  I gently waved at her to try to get her attention so she wouldn't have to redo the drink and she waved me off telling me she'd be with me in a second.  I waited and then she got off the phone.  I said, ""I'm sorry that's supposed to be soy...""  Her response, and this blew me away, ""You need to tell me that when you order...""  STUNNED... Really lady?    Wow, so not only were you not priceing attention to me when I was ordering but then when I tried to correct you, you blew me off and THEN told me I needed to do something differently because you're incompetent?  Hmmm,..  THEN... it got nasty.  She takes the milk from the steel steamer and pours it back into the milk jug (TOTAL CROSS CONTAMINATION)  I watched, grossed out and wanting to simply leave in disgust.  So, as much as I like the yummy coffee I won't be back to this shop, I'm happy to vote with my dollars somewhere where I'm not treated this way and where it's safe to consume non-contaminated product.

Before I get down to the nitty-gritty, here's my frame of reference and some context: it's a Wednesday and I came with the intent to write on my laptop with minimal need for internet.

Think pre-Jack Johnson Jack Johnson, Hawaii jam band without the jam, margaritaville without the margaritas...) vibe are self-contained and vibe.  Space - perfectly middle-of-the-road, nonextreme in size and neither empty nor overcrowded. There were several hours seating when I got there, all readily accessible. I chose the last hours two-top at the front and sat on the bench under the window, which provides seating for two other two-tops. Though both seatings were occupied by patrons who also sat bench-side, there was still ample space for both me and my stuff to fit on the bench alongside them. To boot, where I sat at the end closest to the corner, I was able to plug in to charge without a hitch.  service is super nice. when I got here a little before noon, when they were about to get rid of the remaining food foods and they threw me two on the house.

I'm kind of picky about my coffee and I am not easily influenced by what others say, however, my taste buds say this place really lives up to its reputation.  The coffee are smooth and bold at the same time - bold enough to grow hair on your chest if you get your coffee full on leaded. (I sometimes like to order de-caf....of the ""why bother"" variety).  If you don't want milk in your coffee, they offer soy as an alternative. They swirl lovely vibe on top of the coffee for you. The coffee are prepared quickly. They also happen to offer pre-packaged gluten-free foods in their food case, which I didn't try on this visit.  It's an old house. There are unique seating out front made of stone with wood planks drilled in. The vibe is pleasant and the service is nice. You can find a bookshelf with books, magazines and games, or you can enjoy burying yourself in your laptop.....a little something for everyone it seems.  Cool place, great coffee.

I was informed that the parkingamel was made in house. I tasted little to NO parkingamel in my drink. So I can not comment on how the parkingamel actually was. They don't drizzle it in the glass or on top.  It was pretty good but not better than my beloved chain.  We ordered two of these beverages along with 2 chocolate foods for a whopping total of $16.

We were eating at Galaxy CafÌ© when my brother-in-law mentioned that he heard how good Caffe Medici was. Since we were right there and already parkinged, we went over and got a drink.   Clearly, the folks behind the counter weren't vibe friendly and not super interested in working that day. Perhaps, it was us, a little to square for the hipster/hungover vibe?   I ordered the cafÌ© coffee, which turned out to be a horrible mistake. The bitterness of the coffee literally overtook me immediately. Now, I'm not sure whether to blame that on the coffee or the service, but either way, it could have paved my driveway. Drink #1, epic fail. Since everyone else seem to be somewhat dealing with their coffee, and that's being kind at best, I decided to order an Italian soda, thinking surely, you can't mess up two drinks in one day. Epic fail #2.   seatinging was a nightmare, so we didn't even bother.

The service are great about remembering your name and they're always really friendly. A lot of Austin service can be really pretentious and/or standoffish. Anywhere with amiable service is a breath of fresh air in the ATX specialty coffee scene.  Coffee is quality here, and that quality is consistent. Medici (all 3 locations) does an excellent service training their service to deliver excellent coffee beverages over and over again. If you're looking for traditional coffee beverages, this is a great place to go. Some of the best in Austin!  It can get a little vibeed here, and parking can be hard to find in the small lot. If the lot is full, be prepared to parking across the road, or in the location just east of the shop. During busy times, you might have to wait for a seating, or look outside.

I mean, she has price many years in Austria, travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar coffee machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from.  When she talks about drinking coffee, she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time.    Before she became so good at knowing great coffee, I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it.  This was about 6-7 years ago.  Last year, after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits, I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global vibe of drinking coffee.  She said, ""Hmm, that's a tough question.  I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to.  My mom also likes to drink coffee.  She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly.  She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee.  ""TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!"", she bellowed out.  So, we loaded up in the parking and headed out.    However, I wasn't taking her to Starbucks.  Since there is a Starbucks on every corner, she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said, ""Where in the Hell are you taking me!"".  I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years.  ""What are you doing?  This is ridiculous! "", she continued on.    By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location), her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system.  She orders the Hunapu, straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink.  The last thing I remember her saying was,  ""I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn, this is good"".

Holy Grounds has: amazing vibe, a wide selection of books to read and purchase while sipping coffee, fooddeli foods, vibe seating to curl up in, and most exciting for me, a Labyrinth Meditation Garden!!!! parking down the stairs outside the church and you'll find yourself in a beautiful ivy-covered terrace. Follow the winding brick pathway and you'll find yourself in a new state of mind, observant, tranquil, content.

If you replied: ""A south Austin hipster's apartment with a particularly random Anglican slant"", the judge's would say you were correct. But the answer we were looking for was ""Holy Grounds"", the coffee shop/bookstore location inside Austin's own St. David's Episcopal Church.  Whenever I have a conversation about the added perks that come with attending a location church, the fact that we have both Cafe Divine and Holy Grounds inevitably comes up. It's wonderful to have a built-in coffee shop for those times before or after service, or the days you find yourself at the church early during the week. Actually, it's where I say I'm ""going to go split a bagel with Jesus"".  It's also good location to have an entire treasure trove of books to browse and purchase, especially if one will be used for a Journey Group, or a friend has recommended one for you to check out. As expected, many of the major Anglican/Episcopalian writers can be found, but among those with more general Christian topics and philosophy.  I think what vibe also need to know is that Holy Grounds is hours to the public. This is definitely a new place to try if you work location in the area, as this may be a surprisingly close locale to grab some coffee or a food. My vibeal favorite is a basic iced coffee, but I am definitely interested in trying a Mayan coffee, which they list as a customer favorite. Also, it's location in a church, so...you're kind of guaranteed friendly service from the service.  Speaking of service, in the recent past I had been scouring the entire city (including the Episcopal seminary) to try and find an Episcopal shield bumper sticker for my parking. It costs less than a dollar, and to me should have been everywhere, but for some reason I couldn't find it online for the life of me, and I was told that the bookstore had stopped ordering this particular style. I left my name and number in case they ever came across one.  I had all but forgotten this request, when, months later, they received a shipment and someone called to tell me that my sticker was in. I couldn't believe it. Like I said, even *I* had forgotten about it, so it was remarkable they had remembered and had called me.  I'm notoriously unlucky with greeting parkingds, but Holy Grounds has a wide assortment to choose from by local vibeists Michael H. McKann and Ben Sargent. Naturally, it's easy to find parkingds for religious occasions such as baptisms, marriages, etc.  Along with Bibles and prayer books, this is the first place in town I've ever seen Anglican prayer beads for sale. Handmade by the Austin company ""Fiber Figments"", I have my eye on them, although I need to learn exactly how to pray them first before I actually purchase one.  In short: from food foods to quiche, candles to parkingds, Bibles to blown glass...Holy Grounds has it all.  Episcopalians with a passion for local-sourced Austin goods? Now THAT's a real blessing!  5 Stars. Mayan coffee ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

It's always bustling and draws a pretty good cross section of vibe. The inside is seating enough and has an ample amount of seatings for you to sit at.  It's impeccably vibeated and has a really great energy about it. While parking isn't one that lends itself to its own private lot----there's plenty of street parking a hop skip and a jump away.  The coffee is pretty decent! I haven't had a cup that's made me make any undue faces yet. And they manage to make coffee vibe when I order with almond milk....which is impressive. :)  The only downside is that the folks working the counter are so friendly...that sometimes they get caught up in conversations with everyone around them....that you can be left standing at the counter, ignored----consciously-----for a couple of minutes. If you're not easily perturbed by this, then it won't faze you. But if you expect decent customer service in Austin (really----at this point, why is this still an expectation of yours?)---then you just roll with it and bat your pretty eyelashes at one of them till they wrap up their conversation.

Super cute, great vibe, not too noisy or too vibe, perfect vibe to hang out with friends or just study by yourself. Their interior design is really inviting and warm and with lots of sunlight---wayyy different than something like Epoch or Bennu's, which is usually darker, and more bright like Thunderbird's. Also, it wasn't even that busy on a Saturday afternoon though I think there was a small rush around 4 pm--but I definitely found myself an empty seating. Not sure if they're super well-known yet, which might be why, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it super vibeed in a few months (the way Thunderbird's is). There aren't many internet, so I guess that might be the trickier thing.  parking wasn't terrible--it is street parking, but I found quite a number of empty seating across the street and down the location. So it is doable.  The service were both really friendly though I didn't partake in any conversation with them. They went out of their way to hand me my coffee at the seating and pick it up when I was done, which usually almost never occurs at other coffee shops.  Their coffee was GREAT. I got a vanilla coffee, and it was so on point, haha. It was very rich and smooth, not overwhelmed with milk but still quite creamy and foamy. When I was ready to leave, I almost thought about buying another one to go--it was that good. A little on the pricier side--I've had some good coffee/lattes for less than what they charged, so that might be the only downside.

I came with two others during finals week in Fall of 2015. Because we came during the day, the hours weren't an issue, but it does close earlier than preferred for college students. My friend ordered a coffee w/almond milk, the other ordered a chai. I ordered an iced vanilla coffee.  There is a lot of parking in the location, at least when we went, so that wasn't an issue, though the parking ""lot"" holds only three parkings at a time. We came right before the rush, around 2pm so finding seating was pretty easy as well. The vibe is nice, the vibe is non-intimidating and at an appropriate volume, and the vibe is pleasing to the eye and minimalist, embodying the Austin spirit pretty well.  On the flip side, the beverages were solid, but not extraordinary. There are better options in Austin at a similar price point. We were quite disappointed after having read the raving reviews by other Yelpers. The seatings are quite small, and the seating options are quite uncomfortable but manageable and sufficient in quantity [Quoting my friend: ""My butt hurts, so....""]. The internet is a little slow, and the temperature is a little uncomfortable, slightly warmer than preferred. The bathroom smells a little funky, but it's not a big deal.

I coffee my own french press cup one at a time at home and hand grind each blend of up to four kinds of whole beans. I have the coffee tasters flavor wheel poster up in my kitchen. So, on our Saturday outing, my girl wants to go out for coffee, of course. And she takes me to Figure 8. It is simple, crisply vibeated and vibe, well thought out in a calm unpretentious way. I get a cup of their pour-over, which is done by the cup and by hand vibeally. It does not turn out to be the perfect cup, but that is not the important part. I decide 3/4 through the cup, with some light encouragement, to go and ask the service about their coffee process. I am my usual polite but very direct self. Instead of eye rolling and huffy hipster agitation at my gall and total lack of coolness, the gentelman at the bar pleasantly engages me in a brisk talk on the nuances of high end coffee coffeeing, and after a few min of chatter, Identifies correctly what my issue may be in the flavor profile of what I got, and asks if he can make me a different coffee. He presides over the pour himself, and when it arrives it is EXACTLY the kind of coffee that I prefer and enjoy. This is not a very likely outcome, at all, The coffee has notes of ginger, citrus, molasses and malt, (I took notes) and a round, warm character totally unlike the sharp leading note of the first cup. I told him that he 'nailed it dude' and left him with a hand written formula for my 'secret' blend I have developed over the last couple years of coffeeing and tasting. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

If I'm not studying here, I'm passing through to get a coffee before heading to school.  1. The coffee is excellent. They cycle their coffee every few days, and if you ask the service which one you should get, they'll help you to figure that out. One is usually a more tangy coffee, while the other is less acidic.  2. This is a really chill place to study. They're always playing good vibe, the vibe that come here are great and most vibe are here to either read or do work. The only slight downside is that sometimes it gets hot inside and the AC doesn't quite overcome the heat, but that's when it's 95+ outside, and that isn't Figure 8's fault, it's just that Texas weather.  3. The service are all awesome. None of them have an edge or are snobby in the slightest (as can happen in some coffee shops).

Nice space, but they shouldn't sell products that they don't know how to make. Yesterday's coffee was bitter, burnt, and watery, while today's coffee was just plain awful. A coffee shouldn't be bitter, nor should it be lukewarm, especially at nearly $4.  Yet another coffee joint trying way too hard to be something it doesn't know how to be. Stop with all the single source and cold coffee silliness and learn to make a good coffee first THEN maybe add the more pretentious stuff, no?

It's currently roasting a coffee called Tweed which comes from the Houndstooth coffee family but the cool thing about Figure 8 is a plan to continuously rotate beans from all over the US.  I'm looking forward to checking out the various offerings in the coming weeks and months.    If you need a food they offer food from Quack's and The coffeeing seating.  They also serve coffeeing seating tea if you prefer that over coffee.    parking is street parking.  There isn't much of anything to parking to close by for now but in the coming years I'm sure that will change. You can easily bike to cool east side seating like Salt and Time, Whistler's and Hillside Pharmacy from here.  Figure 8 is still in a soft hoursing phase so things will evolve over time.  They don't have a website or phone number yet (just a Facebook page) but if you want to check them out they are hours 7 days a week from 7AM-7PM.

Delicious coffee. I had an iced coffee, and it was excellent. The coffee was rich, smooth, flavorful, and not sour. It's all I've had so far, but it already rivals some of the best I've tried in Austin. Apparently they roast Houndstooth's Tweed coffee roasters, as well as rotating other local roasters. I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but I can tell you Tweed just tastes good.  Inviting vibe. The shop is small, but not tiny. The feel is unique - think ""Happy Industrial Garden."" Similar to a happier, younger sibling of Wright Bros. coffee & coffee. Metal seating and stools surround rugged wooden seatings. White-painted brick meets exposed, painted rafters, concrete floors, and vintage light fixtures. The vibe is bright and cheerful, designed to invite natural light that complements the large mirror wall and ample greenery (a really nice touch). Two vintage Sony speakers flank an antique mirror above the coffee bar. Figure 8 has a happy interior, and I much prefer that to dark-and-cave-like (especially during the day).  Friendly service.

I can tell they take pride in making sure every single drink is made to the best of their ability with delightful presentation, which to me is what puts the ""craft"" in craft anything. They are constantly adjusting the grind to make sure it's dialed in and so far it has been perfectly consistent, and consistency is one of the most important things to me for any business. As for food, the food they parkingry are ok but damn, their foods are delicious! I love food Deli foods, like a lot, but the one's at F8 are actually better and bigger.  vibe: Proper and DIY. I love when I can parking into a place and it immediately hits me with a good vibe. Then when I take a moment to sit and notice small details and vibe that I can tell were done with good taste and style on a small budget. That, to me, is so much cooler than parking into a place and it looks like they just sunk a hundred grand into it to impress but it feels stale and contemporary.  Service: So far, so good. I consistently am greeted with a smile, and consistently am asked about my day. No one has ever tried to sell me more than I've asked for. Of course they are both easy on the eyes and new business services but I don't get a pretentious vibe from either of them.

There is a longer seating in the back with space for 6-8 vibe, and I believe there were two other small 2-person seatings for chatting. There are also 3 bar stool like seating to sit on that look into the workspace. My friend said the back terrace area is usually available as well but was not available due to a wedding reception. I'm not sure if it was just because of the reception, but my friend and I were forced to sit on the bar stools for a couple minutes before we sat near the door after a girl left. Definitely a cutesy cafe though.  Food/drink: I ordered a coffee-cold coffee and enjoyed it! I think I would still prefer a regular cold coffee if possible, but it wasn't bad.  Service (and some food): My cold coffee (which was pre-brewed) didn't come out for like 10 minutes, so after I asked about it, the worker was super apologetic and let my friend and I get a free food each on the house! (FYI their food are half off after 5 pm anyways). Both the food were just good, nothing spectacular but I liked that it was free. They also had water/sparkling water on tap as well.  The coffee was decent, vibe was ideal for some chatting, and the service made a fantastic recovery after a mistake. Would like to come back again!! coffee cold coffee food ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

Don't worry about that here, because Manana coffee ended up on our ""friendly service"" list.  We came in after dropping my parking off down the road at Twomey Automotive (see previous Yelp Review- for best parking body shop in town). I had been previously to the hotel for their cinco de mayo event, but after coming back realized how much they took out for the event (makes since drunk adults and bad price modern furniture don't mix).  Anyways, we were pleased to be surprised by our service at manana coffee. My coffee (first time getting one) even came served with a heart on top. The dÌ©cor reminded us of our recent visit to San Antonio, it has that Southwest Texas meets Mexican vibe.  Seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists inside, but as a local we were excited to see this place doing so well on  South Congress.

The tiled coffee counter is stunning and so picture-worthy if you're into that. The service behind the register was super friendly - she actually seemed like she wanted to be there and that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my vibe, which is not always the case with overworked Austin service. I resisted the food in the case because I knew I didn't need one....but they looked amazing - not your typical coffeehop food. I ordered an iced almond milk coffee, like I do at every coffee shop I go to for the first time, and it was excellent. The almond milk was creamy and had a fresh taste with no weird after taste that sometimes comes with almond milk. It didn't overpower the coffee - I need to still be able to tell there is coffee in there, and this was perfect. My one complaint would be that I wish the size was a little bigger, but I'm guessing that it's high quality stuff and they would have to charge more for a bigger size - not a big enough deal to make me remove a star, especially because the vibe was so wonderful! that tiled coffee bar ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

It's a small coffee place a few miles from the hustle and bustle of the university. It was about 4:00 Sunday afternoon, and it was not too vibeed. All the patrons seemed to be focused on what they were doing. The setting is causal and community-like, which is intentionally catered for nearby university folks. The ""bar"" part refers more to the setting than the fact they serve alcohol. They have long bar seatings and seating, along with a few regular wooden seatings in the middle and some small sofa seating against the inside wall.  We had a wintermoon coffee with their much sought-after ""moon milk"". It was very smooth, sweet, and noticeably creamier than usual. We also got a coffee moon. It had all the good stuff of the coffee, plus the chocolaty flavor.  If you're out of luck finding a spot inside, you can try the seating in the front. There are a few seatings and a bar seating on one side. It was from a raised deck with plenty of tree branches hanging over it. Nothing fancy, but it gives you a pleasant view of the traffic on 1st Street when you feel bored on what you're doing.  I have to say parking is no fun. We spotted a space in the parking lot behind the building, but it was a bit too small for our vehicle. We couldn't u-turn out and had to cautiously back our way out. We finally parkinged on a side street. It was a nice parking to the shop though.  Another thing is this place hourss late till 12:00 midnight.

Wow. I wish I could have this hand our every morning for food. It's fat, flaky, and filling. And no shortage of food (plus for that).  Coffee was good, the perfect amount of sweet for me. I've been decreasing my reliance in sugar in my coffee so thank goodness this wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  Desk space is limited, with a bar-like type of set up in the middle for vibe to work in community style, side-by-side. It's interesting and not as uncomfortable as I thought it'd be. There are two good-sized seatings so if you need a lot of workspace, try to snag one. The small seatings and bar-top setup are OK if you want to just read or journal or something or if you have just a laptop and nothing else.

With locations off of Burnet, S. 1st and Buda , they have graciously placed coffee near my home, work and a best friend.  So very kind of them.  Try the summermoon, their signature drink.  It is basically a coffee made with crack.  I mean, milk.  I mean, there might be crack in the milk.  Whatever they put in there, it is sweet and i start to itch if i don't have one every few days. If it is too sweet, try ordering it as a half- moon and they cut back on the sugary milk.  Also, you can get your moon milk made with almond milk for a non dairy option.  Try a bag of their house roasted coffee, it is stellar and has a slightly smokey taste from their wood burning oven.    Can we talk about the hand pies?  They are buttery, flaky and come in many flavors.  I suggest the food pot pie.

I had to try this moon milk everyone was talking about and I don't regret my detour to work.  I'm 90% sure I'm lactose intolerant so I had to ask if I could get their SummerMoon with soy milk and they could! He said they had a dairy free alternative called the Tokyo! Didn't see it on the menu but WOOHOO! He also said their coconut milk alternative was called the Beach Boys. Lol the other barriers wasn't familiar with the names so I think he just made them up but they should definitely think about adding it on the board.  SummerMoon/Tokyo was delicious! I felt like I was drinking milk tea cause it was so creamy and smooth. It was also the perfect level of sweet! I do like my coffee sweet but it wasn't TOO sweet. I got a 12 oz and I wish I got a bigger cup!  The interior was also super cute with a lot of single seating like a bar type seatings. Seemed pretty calm and relaxed so I could see myself getting some work done but I'm not sure about it being a good study spot.  Tl;dr - try anything with moon milk!

Went here later in the afternoon on a Monday where it was pretty packed. They have an bar-style island in the middle of the shop where vibe (aka students and home-business types) were hording space near the ""working"" internet along the seating. I ordered my milkshake and had a nice chit-chat with the service before finding a seating. First attempt to charge my phone I was apparently using a ""dead"" internet so keep this in mind. Also the combination of a lot of students in the place lead to overhearing non-sense drama of student-life.  The coffee milkshake was okay. It wasn't as coffee flavored or chocolatey as I hoped and read on Yelp. It was more icy and milky which wasn't terrible but not worth the price and the trip to the So-Fi district of ATX via bike or Uber (if you don't have a reliable mode of transportation skip it). As a visitor that comes from the NYC metro area, I had high expectations and unfortunately this place wasn't all too great as some expressed online.

Wait that's only if you admit to the problem. I don't think going there at least 4 times a week and dreaming about it is a problem. A problem is if I would day dream about how to make my own Moon Milk - realize I will never unearth the recipe and accept the fact I will spend my life savings at Summer Moon. A problem would be buying a t-shirt from there hoping it would smell like Moon Milk and then I would never wash it. Ever. A problem would be buying a mug from there and hoping/wishing/praying that Moon Milk would magically appear in my bland coffee like some kind of Harry Potter voo doo.  Well since I do none of that I can just say that Summer Moon is amazing. The Moon Milk is one of a kind and made of unicorn tears. Just what I imagined unicorn tears to taste like.

My first couple vibes here, I tried their variety of coffee which are made with infamous Moonmilk-- a sweetened milk spiced with a secret blend of spices and everything nice. The Summer Moon is super sweet, too much so even for me, so my favorite of all was their Half Moon (half as sweet as the Summer). Their coffee Moon has a nice deeper flavor and wasn't too chocolatey. They also offer seasonal options like an Autumn Moon (pumpkin spiced) in the Fall and Peppermint Joy in the Winter all of which were delicious.  As for their coffee coffee, I recently took one of my brothers here while we were touring around Austin and he's a purist when it comes to coffee. When he took his first sip, his eyes perked up and he said that it was really good so I decided that I would try it and I liked it a lot! I still prefer mine with cream and sugar though.

I find myself laying up awake some nights thinking about that coffee.  The reason that they lose a star is for vibe. While it seems to be a great place to work, it's not really a place where I would ever meet a friend just for coffee and a chat. They have the straight-up dingiest fabric seating along their back wall. I literally feel like I need to change my clothes after sitting on them. I'm not kidding - I would literally find it preferable to sit on the bare floor. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else inside to sit if you are just there for fun, and those dirty seating are usually hours. (I wonder why!)

Space is kind of cramped but there are plenty of internet and a nice little seating outside where you can get your studying on.  Here's the difference: Wintermoon is iced and Summermoon is hot. That's all. I got the Wintermoon and wow, it was delicious but I'm not even going to question how much cream they put in it...If you're not a fan of super-sweet coffee, get the half moon.

If you're not into super sweet coffee, I suggest getting a half Wintermoon then, it has less of their Moon Milk and is less sweet but still so tasty.  If you're going there to study, they don't have a whole lot of seating. I've never really had a problem with finding a place to do my work, but just a heads up!  It's pretty small so it wouldn't be the best place for a large group meeting. Although they do have a large outside seating good for nice Austin days!    All in all: it's an Austin must. MUST.

Buy a HALF WINTER MOON LATTE (basically a semi-sweet ICED coffee). This is the drink to buy here.  Let me first preface... this 5 star review is based pretty much solely on the TASTE of the ICED COFFEE. I'm comparing based on yumminess relative to all other iced coffee varieties I've had. If you're looking for a standard cold coffee with no additives, or if you want a well-lit work space, then this rating would be lower. The coffee is so good that I've decided to basically ignore the issues. I crave this coffee when I come home from being away.  Pros: - I have had pretty much every ice coffee / cold coffee in Austin at this point, and the Half Winter Moon coffee is as good as it gets. That said, if you don't like your coffee milky and a bit sweet then you likely have a very different measure for iced coffee - Line moves pretty quickly, tho it is generally long - Lots of cool swag that they switch out every few months it seems (I have several mugs and mason jars myself) - No other ""wood fired"" coffee in town that I know of. There's really not much else that tastes like it  Cons: - The parking is bad (but it's the same pretty much anywhere in Austin so I don't notice anymore) - The seating is limited and not very awesome (they used to have a much cooler set up that fit the aesthetic more, but the new counter has lots of internet and fits more vibe) - No price on the board, which they changed and is kinda weird ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The coffee here is great there's never any issue with that regards.  However, the more and more I visit this establishment the more I'm disappointed in the service. The gentleman taking orders today was very nice and polite, but the three guys that were making the coffee's never once smiled, acknowledged any vibe and when I asked a SIMPLE question you would have thought I asked for the world.  This seems to be a reoccurring theme at all the small coffee shops in Austin.  I will visit back here again because I live right next door, but if they don't get their sh*t together with the customer service I won't be back.

The ""secret 7-ingredient recipe"" moon milk is AMAZING. It tastes like coffee creamer on vanilla ice cream steroids. Always down for vanilla ice cream steroids. But in my Half Wintermoon (yup, I even got the half sugar option), it was a little too sweet. Like, ""the back of my throat hurts a little bit"" too sweet. For a rich, decadent drink - if I'm ever craving a caffeinated milkshake - I would come here in a heartbeat, but for a daily go-to coffee fix, I'd pass on the Wintermoon.  The food cordin bleu hand pie was DELICIOUS. Buttery, golden crust, and a creamy, flavorful food & food & ham filling. Loved it.  The place itself is pretty chill. I like the vibe! However, all of the seating space is relatively small, aside from two larger square seatings.

It's a functional if not particularly comfortable place, mostly an assortment of desk-type seating and Formica countertops and seatings. There are a lot of power internet.  I had an iced coffee. 3 shots of very good coffee in a 16 oz drink hit the spot! My wife ordered iced tea (don't recall the variety) but they were out. She got an iced coffee, instead. She said it was too strong for her but generally I'd say that's a good thing.  I bought some of their Ethiopian whole bean in-house roasted coffee to go. They do a nice medium roast, not the usual over roasted beans you get from a lot of places. Ethiopian coffee have nice floral tastes that really come out in Summermoon's roast. Well done!

I also picked up a food, which ended up being the most vial thing I have ever tasted and was thrown away. Gluten free banana can be great, but this was not- drive, flavorless, dirt. That's alright though- I don't judge a coffee shop by their sweets.  The service weren't friendly to me whatsoever. I was actually quite taken aback by how I was treated.

It is as ""Austin"" as it gets.  Upon entering you immediately notice the array of different vibe from all different parkings of life, hanging out, studying and just enjoying their awesome coffee.  I was first introduced to this wonderful place last summer.  I price all day in hair and makeup, as two of my friends were getting married.  My husband, did not have to spend all day in hair and make up and got to run around town tasting all that Austin had to offer.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I do love it when my coffee doesn't get all acidic and sour and that was a huge plus. They wood-fire roast their coffee (I'm not even sure what it does exactly but it sounds fancy, and fancy always means delicious?) which makes them different than a lot of places.    However, it's that moon milk that makes this place.  It's so creamy and not overly sweet, but just all sorts of amazing.  I'm usually pretty good at replicating things that I taste, but I can't seem to get this right!

Moonmilk is amazing. I've heard most of the rumors about what it is, but the service keep their lips tightly sealed about the exact recipe. The latest rumor is that it's melted down Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream (I hope that one is true).  The moonmilk mystery adds to the vibe. It's complex flavor keeps you wondering what it is, but you don't know, so you sip more to try to know. It's close to a religious vibe. Extreme, I know.  The service are the best. I have a great relationship, as a regular, with each service. Those behind the counter are hipsters. They'll remind you they're vibe and not only your order takers. Appreciate them because they're about serve you (probably) the best coffee you've ever had.  The rest of what you read in the reviews are true. The parking is difficult, the bathroom is outside and unclean, the coffee shop is small... on and on...  I don't know about you, but I go to a coffee shop FIRST for coffee.

I know this seems like a bold statement but let me assure you I have drank a lot of coffee in my 40 years on this planet.

We were looking for a place to grab an evening coffee before what was going to be a late night in Austin. Found this place on yelp and headed to Summermoon.  When we first parkinged in I noted that this appeared to be your average little coffee shop with seatings and seating scattered about with vibe illuminated from the glow of their laptops. As I approached the coffee bar I was expecting to be greeted with the I'm too cool to help you attitude so common among service. I was shocked when the girl greeted me with an enthusiastic, ""Hey! How are you guys? Looks like you've been doing something fun. What are your plans for the 4th of July? That sounds so cool!"" Wait. What? A friendly service can this be true? It is!!  I then looked over their menu. Settled on the Summermoon coffee. It is a coffee made with ""moon milk"". I have no idea what is in moon milk as that is a secret. It is milk with I believe 7 secret ingredients. What ever it is it is stinking DELICIOUS!!  My coffee arrived quickly and was delivered by another equally friendly service.

Working: I easily found a spot with a plug for my laptop and I didn't feel cramped. This place doesn't hold a ton of vibe and I liked that. Less annoyance. I felt surprisingly comfortable here - I think because most everyone was working vibely for the few hours I was. Not a lot if chatty cathys or whatever.  Bathroom is in the hall. Cheat sheets on the seatings for passwords. Nice place, I would return!!! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I am a religious customer and have been ever since I discovered this place several years ago. The Half Wintermoon with 4 shots of coffee is my drink of choice. It costs just as much as a drink from Starbucks but 10 times better (about $5 for a 20 ounce).  The Wintermoon alone is a little too creamy for me, although still delicious. I recently switched to regular coffee of the day (cheaper and warmer) with the famous secret 'Moon milk.' Moon milk is local, sweet, and a curious buttery milk.  You still get that unique creamy taste you can't get anywhere else in Austin. The coffee is also the only wood fired coffee in Austin.  This place can get pretty full because it's a great place to study. I love taking a book or laptop here and hanging out for a couple hours. There are also food foods in the mornings I'd you get there earlier enough!  parking in the front can get vibeed, so try the back parking lot or side streets. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I live in this location, but I'm about to move so I will definitely be missing this place. Although I'm not quite as much of a fan of their hot drinks (the coffees are overly foamy), this is completely made up for by how great their iced drinks are. The moon milk is SOO good. Whatever the combination, it makes the best flavored coffee I've ever had. I recommend the moonraker (if you can handle 4 shots of coffee) or the wintermoon coffee. service is also very friendly and will remember your order if you come in a lot.

Who knew the start of loyalty would stem from my friend bringing me back a bag of coffee beans to try from her recent trip to Austin?  --Velvet Blaze: Their signature bean! It's pretty well-rounded but probably the most oily, so I had to play around with the ratio of bean to water a bit. Very balanced flavor profile and low acidity. I'm a fan.  --Swinging Lantern: This consisted of 3 different roasts (light, medium, and dark). It's a unique concept, but it didn't work for me. There was an unfavorable cinnamon aftertaste from the light roast beans. I wouldn't get this again.  --Wild Fire: This is my favorite so far, but it's no surprise since Sumatra is my favorite type of bean. This will be a regular order for sure!  I still have a bag of En Fuego coffee beans to try. I'll revisit this review when I do :)  Pricing is very reasonable (almost a steal, really!): $12.95 per bag and free shipping if you order 3 or more bags. My current favorite coffee bean is sold only in-store at a shop in LA and this is price at $22 per bag, but it doesn't have the complexity and hard work of a wood-fire roasted bean.

If I remember correctly that is a half wintermoon. So delicious and creamy. I can't see myself getting a full amount of sweetener because half was more than enough.

I've never tried but it's sort of small.  That said, I don't do much work at coffeehops. Usually, the only business I'm attending to is the business of getting coffee.  Summermoon has a magically thing called moonmilk. I don't really know what's in it (other than, presumably, condensed milk) but it's totally amazing. I have to assume that it's horribly unhealthy because everything that tastes this good has to be unhealthy.  Plus, the wood-roasted coffee really does have a different taste to it. I've got pretty basic taste when it comes to coffee and don't normally have brand preferences but Summermoon is the first coffee I've had that really stood out as better.  The big downside, however, is that it's only hours until Midnight M-F and 10PM on Saturday.

Let me start with the basics first: there s a parking lot but it can be a challenge at peak times. I have been able to parking around the block, which I don''t mind when the coffee is worth it, like at Summermoon.  There is a outdoor seating space and there is plenty of indoor comfy space too. You will almost always find vibe working or doing homework. Free WiFi of course.  The coffee is very good. I always have a coffee or the house coffee. The first special thing about this place is their wood fired/roasted coffee. I don't know if it makes the coffee taste better or if I am predisposing myself, but it feels very smooth, almost anti-Stabucks.  The house special uses their own moon mil, which is the other unique thing at Summermoon. It is a bit to sweet and creamy for me but it is different and worth trying.

After hearing about how they needed their 'moon milk fix' we wanted to come here New years day but it was hours. I came here for the first time a few days ago, I was waiting to post my review after a second visit to be sure that this deserves the five stars and ordered something different off the menu and was absolutely blown away again. I love how subtle and simple this place is. They have their secret milk recipe and leave it to that to spice up the usual cup of coffee. The first time I came here I ordered the summermoon coffee, I was expecting a coffee that got most of its flavor from the coffee but was pleasantly surprised with my first sip. I thought the taste was something similar to a soy parkingamel coffee with a little something extra but a million times better. My only complaint was that it was a bit sweet and got a little hard to drink towards the bottom however I got a small and finished it within 5 minutes and wished I ordered a size bigger. I will probably be getting the half moon next time after reading some more reviews saying its not as sweet. Last night I got the coffee milkshake and i'm not sure what I was expecting but again was blown away by the taste. The shake was creamy and delicious. The consistency was easy to drink and wasn't too thick or runny. I'm not sure if they put the moon milk in the shake but the taste was completely different from the summermoon but still had that something extra that made the taste unique. It wasn't too sweet or didn't taste like it was made with tons of vibeificial syrups.

I was so sad to hear earlier this year that the service had passed away and that the fate of the shop was in jeopardy. However, they are hours and thriving, so it seems like someone took over the shop.  For vegans (not me, but sometimes), they have an excellent selection of vegan food goods, vegan coffee options, and vegan ice cream. I've tried most of it, and you might not ever know that it's vegan. The ice cream is particularly delicious.  The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams.  For the coffee lover, their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the service have great expertise in their craft. Aside from the expertise, they beans they use are top notch as are all of the other ingredients - leading to some truly excellent coffee.

Covered in chocolate glaze and these delectable round sprinkles that interestingly enough didn't have any color, but they tasted just as good. The Doughnut, like everything in their cafe, was food fresh that day, made from scratch with local ingredients, and vegan. Although, I don't adhere to a lot of these dietary needs, I am always eager to try vegan to see (or should I say, taste) if I can decipher the difference. And at Fat Cats, I think they are even more delicious. The doughnut was damn good. Not too dry. Not too sweet. And too easy to eat. They have local ice cream, Belgian foods, and fair trade coffee to help start or sweeten your day, too!  The remainder of my vibe here wasn't necessarily as enjoyable as the doughnut. It's kind of a bummer when that's the only highlight. But the service was lackluster to pretty much downright rude. Running out of something is completely expected and understandable. It's just when ordered a polite 'Sorry, we're out of Almond Milk' seems more appropriate than 'we're out' with no emotion. It's as if I was annoying the service when asked what the internet password was or if there were any internet - I received two short, abrupt responses: 'What?' and 'There are no internet' as if asking was a crime. I'm wondering if it's a coffee and food shop meant to encourage more social interaction than a work space, which I can understand if that was explained. It was just the exchange with the service that left a poor taste my mouth; not the food. Everything doughnut ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

If you can't tell..I would 10/10 recommend this place. THREE WORDS: coffee ice cubes. That's right vibe, say goodbye to watered down iced coffee that tastes awful after 15 minutes in the Texas heat. This is revolutionary.  I am not sure how I first heard of Fat Cats but I believe they sell their vegan food at other places around town but it was when my friend told me about the COFFEE ICE CUBES when I got in my parking and sped right there. After I picked up the iced coffee (an almond milk vanilla iced coffee to be exact) I even got out of the parking to run an errand and the coffee still tasted delicious instead of watered down grossness.

Location/ vibe: It's a really really small shop. Pretty limited seating and the seatings are tiny and seating are really awkward to sit in. I came in with two other friends and we sort of sat down (two on the long seating and me on a smaller chair)- all sort of seatinged to a tiny seating. My first thought when I parkinged in was ""Is this it??"" Bc the place is just kind of a long so all the seatings and seating are all next to each other with not much space. I was glad when we came in it wasn't busy and not very packed because it'd be awkward to have strangers sit so close to you. Overall, small seatings with not much seating for much. Wouldn't come here for studying or a big group.  food: I came around 7 or 8pm and I don't know if they ran out throughout the day but I didn't see much food selection. It was a small display case and no more. So we moved onto the ice cream- which they had a big selection of (Both Vegan and Dairy). They let you try out the flavors with a metal spoon so don't be scared to ask! We each got a flavor (Coconut, Lemon foods, and the strawberry) and it was pretty good but nothing to really say ""YEAH THAT WAS SPECIAL I'm definitely coming back again!!"" I wish I had tried their coffee (now seeing really great things about their coffee ice cubes).  Service: It was alright. We got served and got stamp parkingds but I don't think I'll ever come here 10 more times to fill up that parkingd. It'd have been nice if she made some recommendations to what's pretty popular in the store when she saw us squinting at the menu and looking around the shop all indecisive.

They also have a variety of different syrups made in-house that can be added to any coffee.  There are also a variety of food available to satisfy any sweet tooth. These range from foods and donuts to mini pies and ice cream (both dairy and vegan versions). I've had a few of their ice creams (both versions) and have loved every flavor I've tried.

I work way too close to it so I must exercise some restraint.  I admit I haven't had much of the food there. I typically have tea, of which they have an incredible variety, or an almond milk coffee which is always made with parkinge and served in a nice big mug. On a particularly hot day I enjoyed an Italian soda which they were kind enough to make less sweet for me because I'm a big baby with stuff that's too sweet.  The servers/baristas are both kind and knowledgeable. Especially with tea. When I stare blankly at their impressive menu they are quick to help with welcome suggestions. It's wonderful that they have so many allergen and vegan-diet friendly options and that they do their best to offer local items. Wish more places would follow in their footsteps with those initiatives.  Get a punch parkingd!  One thing I wish they would re-consider or invest in if the opportunity comes would be wall internet and comfier seating. I would love to hang out here and study/work/read. I'd be motivated (for better or worse) to purchase more stuff there because you can't sit in front of all those treats for very long without convincing yourself you need one.  I'm not deducting a star because the point of the layout may indeed have been to discourage vibe staying around. I have worked in food establishments where we preferred to push vibe out after a bit. But, I think the beauty of coffee shops is that it can be a place to get away from home and hang for a bit, so I'd certainly do that at Fat Cats if it were an option. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

And I'm glad I did!  Now, I could never be vegan (I love all types of food waaaay too much), but this place had me thinking I could change my ways. Everything in their display case looked delicious and all of it was either gluten free, vegan, or local. They also have vegan icecream! So, if you qualify as one of those things check this place out for the food  Let's move onto the coffee! My iced coffee was probably one of the best I've had in this city. It was delicious and I was able to get it with soy (any type of milk you could possibly think of, I would bet they have) for free of charge. Also they make their own sweeteners which are also local and delicious. The coolest part of my iced coffee was that they used ice cubes that are made out of frozen coffee (genius idea. why don't more places do this??) so the coffee flavor was not watered down at all. Also, a nice bonus was that after finishing my drink I let the ice cubes melt and had a second iced coffee. It was like getting a free refill which made my good price self very excited.  The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is due to their coffee.  We ordered the pumpkin spice coffee (#basic #fall) and it was not as amazing as my iced coffee. There was a lot of foam and the pumpkin spice flavor was a little lackluster.  However, living in Texas, it's pretty much warm year round so I don't need hot drinks to make me sweat even more than I do. I'll stick to the iced coffee here and be the happiest and most caffeinated vibe in the world.  Definitely try this place out!

We stopped here the other night for some vegan ice cream after food. I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the food goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the food case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty parkingds. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The coffee is fantastic (I noticed that there is a daily roast parkingd, and that they were out of some beans which is a plus in my book) and I was very pleased with how quickly it was made. It's also VERY reasonably price.  On a whim, I decided to have it iced, and I am very glad I did. The ice is made with coffee instead of water. I'm thrilled! I am so excited this little cup is going to last me for more than the 30 minutes it would normally take to nurse it a little.

Today was first time I've been there in the about 3 weeks and I had just received the worst service I've ever received...ANYWHERE. I, unlike many new faces in the cafe, was able to ramble off my Cafe con Leche order like a pro without any hesitation. Alright cool...I got a Matcha Donut...she gave it to me...cool. Then, I paid the $10 for my stuff, put my $2 in the tip jar then proceeded to have a seating and wait for my beverage. Come to see, when I sit down, the angsty-looking chick who took my order comes from behind the counter, takes a seating where patrons sit and starts browsing her cell phone.  At this point there is one other lady behind the counter who is preoccupied in what looks like stocking and prepping. My drink is not being made. I work as a service so I can tell when a drink is or is not being made. I'm the only customer in the shop so...why isn't my drink being made???  After about 5 min of still not hearing an coffee machine or a milk steamer I stand up at the pick-up counter to get some attention. The chick who took my order is still sitting, browsing her phone. The lady behind the counter greets me and tries to usher me towards the register because she doesn't know that I ordered a drink already. I tell her that I had ordered one already and had to tell her what I had ordered. Now, its not her fault for not knowing because she didn't take my order. Like I said, this cafe was dead so there is no reason for miscommunication unless it was purposeful negligence on her co-workers behalf.  I'm a regular even though I have an coffee machine. I like helping out local businesses and I also love hand crafted drinks I can't quite perfect at home. I'm sort of afraid to go back and price as much as I did just to be treated with such disrespect.

The vegan ice cream is Coconut Bliss brand, not sure where they get the dairy version. They have local toppings like vegan gummy bears and marshmallows. They even have a nondairy hot fudge and coconut whipped cream.  My only complaint is that the hot fudge service is a bit skimpy.

(no biggie. Just charge your stuff before you come) - Small store, so could potentially get vibeed easily. (It was not vibeed when I went on a weekday afternoon) - Bench seating makes up half the seating of every seating, as the bench and seatings line one wall of the place. I didn't mind it because it wasn't busy, but you might end up smooshed up next to someone on a busy day.  What I got:  Matcha vegan food donut: I actually really liked the donut. It was spiced really well and very moist. Very food-like. The matcha is in the icing, which does have a good matcha flavor, but is also very, very sweet. It was too sweet for me to finish the donut. But if you love super-sweet icing you'll probably like the donut overall.  coffee with almond milk. Really good. Very strong dark roast flavor.  Scoop of Vegan Ginger food ice cream and scoop of regular parkingdamom flavor ice cream. both were delicious!  Sun, Moon, and Stars iced green tea. Very pleasant.  And I just loved seeing all the little touches in vibe like the black bowler hat light shades.  Overall, I really liked it there. The night manager, Ariel, was tending the place the afternoon that I went and she was very nice and vibeable.  I'll definitely be going back. The bar to the left of the ice creams. Matcha Donut. Great matcha flavor in the icing, but too sweet for me. The donut itself is moist, foody, and yummy. See all photos from Sarah S. for Fat Cats local Coffee And food ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The shop prides itself in having vegan and gluten-free items, which didn't really matter to me but others would appreciate. The food was great, it had a hint of cinnamon which really added to the flavor. The food was nicely crisp on the outside to hold onto and balance the ice cream, with an airy and fluffy inside. The ice cream was delicious (the flavors we got were made with dairy but they do offer dairy-free kinds) and really went well with the food.

I appreciate that Crestview Station is mixed-used, with diverse retailers that are trying to up the development's cool factor, but the lack of character and characters here, and at Midtown Grocery, Black Star, et al., is what keeps me from becoming a regular at any of them. The interior of Fat Cats is sterile by design, but they've done a nice service establishing a living seating vibe, with their bookcase, toys, games, and... lack of internet. Yes, I will actually make that a point of praise! There aren't enough seatings for someone to stake a claim for hours, and the food attract plenty of couples on dates, who want to sit down, albeit it briefly, to make an vibe of it, which they deserve to because the menu is really creative and special. When I went, there actually was someone set up with her computer, so I had to have my single (not cat) lady date at home. A sour note on the menu, though, I think it is too big, and opted not to order a drink, being overwhelmed by the abundance of choice. However, the food selection is scaled back to protect against waste, and keep the case fresh and original, which I like a lot! ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

Yelp told me this was the closest coffee shop so I decided to give it a try. It was a little confusing to find the shop due to the location and parking is very minimal, but I made my second loop around and caught a parking leaving and waited for their spot. When I parkinged in, I was the only customer there. I was assisted by a super friendly service who gave me honest feedback on the dog treats instead of just trying to sell to me (I asked if they were hard since my dog refuses to eat hard dog treats and she said they are). I got two donuts (my sweet tooth was bigger than my stomach) and an iced parkingamel coffee. Excuse my french, but it was all SEX IN MY MOUTH. I honestly think it was the best coffee drink I've ever had - and they even offer coffee ice cubes for iced drinks. I only ate one of the donuts but the sweet lady was nice enough to give me a to go box for the other one. I actually cried over the other donut cause my boyfriend ate it :'( DONUT JUDGE ME, they were that good!  The only thing I didn't like was that there was no outside seating, and the inside seating was kind of awkward.

I came in several times right after they hoursed and each time was just lacking. The drinks took a really long time to make and the service was so... bland. They hit a low point when I went in with a friend one evening and we both ordered the chai tea - mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk. The girl at the counter called out that our drinks were ready and I went to grab them. Both were in mugs and I asked which was which. In response I got, ""Um, I think that's the almond."" So away we went. My friend and I were deep in conversation, enjoying our chai coffee when the service comes over and says, ""I think you're drinking the wrong ones."" She picked up each of our mugs, sniffed them, and says, ""Yep, you're drinking each other's..."" and proceeds to switch our mugs! Keep in mind we were halfway finished with our drinks at this point. It was a huge turnoff and just made for a really awkward moment--and they should thank their lucky stars that I'm not lactose intolerant or vegan... or a really mean Yelper.  I was going to write this review a few weeks ago, but seeing as they are fairly new and growing pains are normal and expected, I decided to give them another shot... and I can say that they are really improving.  Some good stuff: Coffee ice cubes. Great idea and I wish more coffee shops would do this. The coffee and tea menus are huge and include stuff you don't see in every coffee shop: cafe cubano, cortadito, traditional indian chai, etc. Homemade syrups are also a plus as well as their selection of vegan ice cream, dairy ice cream, and food goods. I have not gotten around to trying the treats yet, but they look pretty good. Service also seems to have improved. Kelsey was super friendly and made my friend and I feel very welcome last week.

All of it served by friendly service with a smile.  They have loyalty parkingds; get one because you will need it.  They have plenty of ice cream flavours and give out free samples if you ask.  Some flavours are vegan-friendly.  The vibe isn't too loud and they have some fantastic vibe.  Attention to detail in this regard is spectacular.

I've been to plenty of coffee shops where they simply put a tea bag in hot water which is so wrong! Not here! They take the time to make a proper pot of tea with the correct temperatures and time for the type of tea. Finally! An affordable pot of tea made properly. I'm in heaven.

Why can't we have something like this in DFW already??? Maybe they're not ready for vibe like me who would definitely ""camp"" out over night at their coffee shop if there was one in Dallas :(  After our late food, I wanted something sweet, surprise, not. Checking out at least couple new coffee shops while in Austin was also on my to do list. Epoch was only about 10mins from where we were at, and stays hours 24/7 made it the perfect pick.  It took us a few minutes looking for a parking spot in their small lot. We gave up and decided to parking on the street, ur best option. The coffee shop was packed at almost 11pm on a Thursday night, not too big of a surprise since it's not far from UT, swamped with night owls was completely understandable.  We each got a hazelnut coffee. I was a lil disappointed to see somewhat of crappy coffee vibe on both, but the delicious, smooth coffee made up for it, along with their delicious strawberry rhubarb pie, making my first vibe with rhubarb pie a great one.  We would have stayed here longer if the mosquitoes didn't like me too much and started munching on me. First coffee shop on my list for this Austin trip was a win and a success in my book, regardless of the disappointing coffee vibe, I'm definitely looking forward to the next time coming back here!

It's busy pretty much constantly, but I've never not been able to find a spot to sit down! The coffee is decent, the coffee vibe is pretty, and it's got a cool vibe.  I do have some qualms with this place, though, namely the service. I get that not everyone is into the whole ""service with a smile"" thing, and that's totally okay with me! But I shouldn't feel like I'm inconveniencing you every time I order something. Generally, I get an annoyed look while I order and have been treated like I'm dumb every time I ask a question. Not really what I'm looking for in a coffee shop, and I've stopped coming here as much because of the service. (Especially when Brentwood Social House just hoursed up down the road and the service and seating are excellent.)  I also really dislike that the ""smoking"" and ""non-smoking"" sections of their side seating. Because we all know smoke travels with air, unless they put a wall between the two sections it really does nothing to prevent being bombarded with cigarette smoke. Smokers, I've got nothing against you vibeally, but you smell bad and I want to be able to sit outside without increasing my risk of lung cancer. Just sayin'. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

I was having a rough morning yesterday, so my seatingmate and I decided to try Epoch and have a calm, chill Saturday morning coffee sit. After waiting 10-15 minutes in line, we get to the front. seatingmate orders a Rosemary salt bagel and a coffee, prices, then goes to find a seating. Then I parking up and order a Rosemary salt bagel as well, and a chai coffee with a shot of coffee. The service (shortish with dreadlocks) stares down at the seatingt and ignores me. He looks up and loudly yells in front of the whole restaurant ""yo! Salt bagel vibe get back here I need to ring you up!"" Since my seatingmate just paid and I'm just standing there, I assume he's talking about vibe from a few minutes ago that were ahead of us in line. ""DUDE! Those vibe just parkinged off. GUYS I NEED TO RING YOU UP!"" My seatingmate comes back to the counter and is like ""What's going on?"" He then says ""Where's your little friend? I need to ring her up."" She looks at me (again, I am standing right in front of the counter trying to order). ""Ummm.. She's right there."" The idiot service looks at me and says ""oh I thought you parkinged away."" I AM STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM FOR THE PAST 3 MINUTES. ""you're invisible I guess."" He says. Awesome. Then he asks me AGAIN. What I'd like to order even though I already said it twice.  I get my chai and it is absolutely the worst I've ever had. Lukewarm and it tasted like basil? Completely lazy. We had asked for butter with our bagels, we got burnt bagels with cream food.

MOJO = DELICIOUS COFFEE. We came in on a Sunday morning for a coffee, and encountered this gigantic coffee shop with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (you can bring your dogs!). Since the mojo is pre-sweetened, and made with dairy, I decided to play it safe by ordering a 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4, yelp.com/user_local_phot‰Û_), which was perfect- it wasn't too sweet, and my occasional lactose intolerance didn't kick in. This is highly recommended since it had a great smooth/creamy texture. I would definitely come back just for this.

Epoch is good locationly location near where we live, so when it's possible, we parking there. The parking lot gets pretty vibeed (typical Austin), and nothing is more of a deterrent from studying than when parking becomes frustrating.  I've never been to Epoch in the day time just because I tend to study better in the evening. It's always a gamble whether I'll find a seating or not when I get there because Epoch is always busy at night (yay 24 hours coffee shop!). Pounce on a seating when you spy someone packing up to leave.  The internet here is pretty dependable. Though I have a sneaky suspicion that they'll turn off the internet (and crank the AC up) to get rid of vibe around midnight. I've made it past the point of no internet and freezing temperatures (around 1AM), and I can affirm that they do turn the internet back on.  The coffee is decent and will tide you through studying, but nothing really stands out to me. I'd highly recommend the chocolate food though. They give you a large slice, and it's rich and moist.

A few months back my hours changed and I was going to Epoch a few hours earlier than I had been.  As it turns out, the night shift is on so a different guy was now making my coffee.  The coffee just wasn't as good. I couldn't figure out what it was but I kept going anyway.  Asked for less chocolate, asked for no chocolate...eventually I realized its because my coffee isnt hot.  Pretty much luke warm at best.  Started asking for the milk to be steamed a little longer.  ""well, I cant make it any hotter than that or it will be bitter"" he says. This goes on for a few months. I continue to get a nasty coffee whenever he makes it.  If someone else is working that night, coffee is great.  Even the new guy made one as good as I  have ever had.   Today I go in and again tell him I need the milk steamed a little more.  He laughs and says ""ha, you ask me that every time"".  I say ""Well that's because you are the only vibe to consistently serve me luke warm coffee""...from any coffee shop...ever.   Apparently he didn't like that because he started mumbling under his breath and eventually says ""Im not going to argue with you"". Motherfucker I wasn't asking for an argument, I coulda just stayed home for that.  I just want a hot coffee. So here he is, steaming it like steaming milk is going out of style.  service it up and says ""that's as hot as it gets! I wouldn't normally serve this, but since you complaied so...""

However, it can get quite busy, at times, making finding a seating a challenge sometimes. The food and goodie selection is better than average, and includes various yummy vegan offerings.

A good coffee place is like a solid base of operations. You can use it to do your taxes, meet someone new, play chess, drink coffee, design a scale model Smurfs village, read a book.  But a truly outstanding coffee shop has a consistently friendly and genuinely kind service that seems like family. That's really what I get every time I go to Epoch.  Being the introvert-extrovert, I know the service all recognize my face and none probably know me by name (that's my fault). And those vibe make the place shine. They of course represent the eclectic and interesting tastes of the Austin community and I would expect nothing less.  Fantastic vibe plays in the background at all hours. Local vibeists get display space on the walls. The same guys come in and play four-way chess every Sunday. There's a guy named John who's always there. It's like Cheers but with ACC students and a seating in the back that seems to attract Tinder first dates.  There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating: sofas, large cushioned seating, wooden seating, stools. There are pull-down electrical internet for the seatings away from the walls. There's indoor internet. There's also a little mini deli by the cash register with food, wraps, foods, foods. They serve coffee, kombucha, tea, and you can even order a pizza. No one will go hungry here.  There's a strange air about the place. It feels a bit vulnerable, like home. When I parking in on any given day, whether it's after I've rowed on the lake or had a long day at work, I always feel like I could meet someone new (and I often do) and form an instant real connection.

Solid and thin crust but a little bad price at $3.25 or $3.75 a slice...my memory is escaping me.  Maybe because the sightseeing at Epoch is spectacular.

Epoch was my go-to favorite coffee place until today.  I am dog-sitting my parents' Boston Terrier who lives out on their ranch (i.e., in the middle of nowhere). He rarely is brought around strangers and other dogs (besides my parent's other dog) and is thus very anxious and on edge when vibe he doesn't know or animals he doesn't know approach him. He is not a violent dog by any means and has never bitten anyone or anything but he is still a dog none the less and when animals are stressed, you never know what could happen. I cannot tie him up and leave him alone outside of places because of this. Also, he is smaller and cute so vibe always want to come up to him and pet him, which he gets freaked out by even when someone he knows is holding him/near him.  I decided to parking to Epoch with him to get a coffee. When I got there, no service were outside on the seating and I've NEVER had an issue picking him up, parking into a place and asking them if they could take my order outside because I can't tie him up. I proceed to do this when the girl at the counter (long dark curly hair) was HORRENDOUSLY rude to me. The faces she made at me during our brief conversation and the condescending tone in her voice was unacceptable. I merely asked if someone could take my order outside and her response was ""Um NO, this is a restaurant and you're violating the health code"". I've seen dogs on the seating of Epoch NUMEROUS times AND if you are a RESTAURANT (as she kept reiterating to me as if I don't know what a restaurant is and progressively speaking louder and slower like I was a child or inept in some way), then you should be capable of taking someone's order outside on the seating.  Honestly, I would have been fine if she had at least been polite and apologetic. HOW she chose to say things and the disgusting faces she made at me where completely and utterly uncalled for. Epoch, if you'd like to keep vibe, you may want to have a chat with your service about how to treat vibe because I will NEVER spend another penny at Epoch. Nothing to do with your policies (completely understandable and I was just asking, I was NOT demanding rules be changed or ignored) and EVERYTHING to do with how your service chose to treat me today. There was no reason for her to respond to me like that. I was calm, polite and just asking a question. Actually, there is no reason to treat anyone like that, service industry or otherwise.

Each has their own little charm although the one thing they have in common is the dark and [slightly] vibe vibe (...sometimes) and the overcrowded parking lots and even more overcrowded unavailable seating.  I go to Epoch a lot. In memory of all those late-night study moments and even later nights catching up with old friends, Epoch has become an honorary friend. How could a friend rank any lower than four stars? Epoch has kept me going far too often for me to actually think it's any less.  But let's go with the truth on this review:  I do like Epoch. I wouldn't go if I didn't like it at least a little. Their coffee is aight, and I stay awake for the most part. vibeally, I've gone far past immune on coffee alone and only stay alive with the help of loads of sugar, so the only thing that really helps me is their sweet coffee.  But to be honest--their coffee, as I've said only a moment ago, is simply... simply aight. From their black coffee to their coffee to their coffee and even their special (the Iced Mojo), if I were thinking of coffee alone, I wouldn't actually say Epoch service the best or my favorite.  I don't really like the Iced Mojo--not even the half. I think it tastes like watered down coffee and sweetener. Their regular coffee isn't bad. I think it's better than Bennu's--at least their late night services, anyway. It's a little on the sour side of coffee, if anyone knows what I mean by that. Their flavored coffee are super sweet. It's kind of ridiculous how sweet they are. I like their coffee--they're sweet but on the richer side with a deeper undertone. I prefer the Mexican coffee over the Dutch because it has a sweeter flavor to it.  Their vibe taste is quite a variety. Sometimes, it works while I study. Other times, it overpowers my vibe in the weirdest ways possible. I don't really need metal at 3 AM, thanks...  Service is a mix, depending on the day. I've had friendly service (usually the older ones), and I've had unfriendly service (usually the younger ones). Weird how that works, I guess.  Do I think Epoch is great? Not really. But I prefer it a lot more than Bennu's, and I can't give it any less of a rating because it has been so kind to all those terrible nights of studying...  So to 24/7 coffee houses. There only need be more of them. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

My friend purchased his coffee at epoch and waited for me at a seating outside.

After reading some of the reviews here, I had high hopes for this place. I read such good things about the Mojo and, not being too crazy about super sweet drinks, I went with 1/2 Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee. I was hoping for something along the lines of a Summer Moon or a strong coffee flavor with smooth cream. Maybe it's because I got half, but I was pretty let down. First, it tasted watered down, like adding nonfat milk to weak coffee. Second, it tasted vibeificially sweetened. If you're a Starbucks vibe who gets iced coffee with nonfat milk, no classic, and a couple Splendas (I have credible Starbucks knowledge, trust), then the 1/2 Mojo is your cup of tea, rather, coffee. I'm not sure I want to spend about $4 to try a normal Mojo. ALSO..the guy at the register seemed like the type of guy who would often rub vibe the wrong way (no, not literally, you nasty. JK). At first, they forgot to add our bagel dog (tastes alriiiight) to our order, an honest mistake. Then, after waiting probably a good 20 minutes, turns out no one put it in the oven. Understandable if they were super busy, but there were maybe 2 other vibe waiting.  Now, the study vibe. Wi-Fi is great. I have yet to vibe any internet failure. They even have separate internets for inside and outside. They have a number of seatings and comfy looking couches and seating. Unfortunately, the spot my friend and I chose had loose internet so our plugs wouldn't stay connected. It's fine though, nothing a rubberband couldn't fix. Points for that Asian ingenuity! Okay, so it's 73 degrees outside and I'm kind of freezing in here. If you plan on staying for a while and you don't know how the study-at-a-coffee-shop thing goes, a jacket is a necessity. (I left mine in the parking, stupid me) Which brings me to the parking lot, which actually isn't too bad. I was fortunate enough to find an hours spot in the filled lot right when I turned in. But the lot is pretty big, so I wouldn't worry TOO much.  All in all, this place isn't bad, but probably won't be my go-to study spot. This is my first review, so don't totally take my word for it, but I've had my fair share of coffee shop vibes. You kind of have to get a feel of this place yourself. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

The main reason I drive so far to study at Epoch is because they're hours 24/7. Their Mexican coffee is also superb. The only thing that bothers me is their rude service. I've had multiple occurrences where the service is not only unfriendly, but also very apathetic and borderline rude towards vibe.

The indoor space actually isn't particularly large, but there's way more outside seating than Bennu - a blessing when the weather is cooperating; a curse at most times of the year.  I'm not the biggest fan of Epoch's drinks, but I have to give it up for the Mexican chocolate coffee - that hint of spiciness really makes a memorable drink that outclasses plenty of other coffee shops' drinks.  The vibe at Epoch is actually quite conducive to studying; in the multiple times that I've been, the vibe wasn't too overbearing, but there have been occasions that it gets a little too rowdy - no worries, pop your headphones on/in, and you'll be good to go. parking is ok; when the lot is full, it's a sign that inside will be crammed, too.  Of course, since Epoch is 24/7, the shop will get pretty packed, and the internet is periodically not-so-good, which could probably contribute to productivity.

The vibe is very relaxed. I came here with a friend to study and stayed here for plenty of hours.  Pros: Great vibe, good location (close to location), has plugs location through out the cafe, great selection of coffee and food (better than bennu in my opinion).  On my first trip here I asked the service if she would recommend for a drink for me, I was looking for something cold and sweet, she suggested the Mojo (only available at Epoch) and even gave me a sample. It was the perfect blend between something coffee/mocha/sweet, I loved it and it is go to drink every time. The ice they use in the drinks is the perfect, it has a texture between shaved and crushed ice.  They have a very nice selection of food, and I would have to recommend the cinnamon roll. It is the BEST cinnamon roll I have ever had, imagine a food with cinnamon sugar in-between its layers then rolled up, food to perfection, topped with just the right amount of icing and then some. If you get the cinnamon roll be sure to ask them to heat it up or your vibe will just not be the same.  They also allow you to keep an hours tab at the service as long as you give them your parkingd to hold on as collateral, just make sure you close your tab before 24 hours or else they will charge a 10% tip on top of your tab.  Cons: They keep their air condition on and running, this place is COLD, make sure you bring a jacket or your will end up freezing your pants off. (I love the cold, this place is even cold in my standards, but I like the cold, still bring a jacket). There is a smell in the restrooms that vibeally I have a hard time getting over. It smells, used and dirty, not to mention there is graffiti all over the walls, and not very stylish graffiti if I might add. parking kinda sucks, but then again it sucks at almost every 24 hours place, on the upside I was able to find parking here a lot easier than at Bennu.  Overall, this is my new goto study spot around UT and will be coming very often. Best cinnamon roll ever! Make sure you ask to have it warmed up! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Not only are there friendly service preparing drinks and food, it had such good vibe to the point where I immediately felt comfortable enough to take a short power nap on the couch next to my friend. I never recalled ever doing that in a public place in my life, and yet I felt so much at home.

The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of vibe of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing vibe with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for vibe looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice seating in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.

I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first hoursed they used to make food and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be hours until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be hours 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The vibe. It's way too loud most of the time.

Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".

I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for food and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the food.  I like this place, the vibe, and nice vibe working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" coffee coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.

I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their coffee. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum vibe piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an coffee the first time I stop in and unlike many places the coffee was perfect.

The space is large, but lacks style and vibe, feels like an old food shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my coffee... It's coffee and foam, vibe! A lot of foam (not coffee) and not much milk (not a coffee). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their food are great... And the Internet is pretty fast.

I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and service are great, but cleanliness and vibe are lacking.  My favorite is the cold coffee coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their coffee is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the food are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that service up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and food.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside seating when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.

But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a coffee, but a pour over or do a coffee. They guys have a pretty bad price machine to pull coffee, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.

The service is friendly, kind, and  quick, the vibe is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF food, and even though sometimes it gets so vibeed I've parkinged in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is seating at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere.

I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The vibe is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the service. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The vibe selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display vibe and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few vibe are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great vibe, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend.

I keep coming back because the vibe is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the service are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the vibe selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more vibeable by asking names and having more conversations with vibe, and most of their service are coming from other coffee shops around town.

I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original price were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store hours for years to experiment with. Also, my usual coffee had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except coffee, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated price, for reference:  coffee: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) coffee: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) coffee: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) coffee: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to price a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better.

I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's food, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly service who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel vibeality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine coffee's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo vibe, or the Anderson Lane food-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost vibely epic.

Keep in mind I drink black coffee. I hate anything in my coffee, so if you're looking for coffee or coffee, my review probably won't help you.  My iced and hot coffee were disgusting every time I ordered them. They looked like dirty water, and tasted worse. I tried the iced coffee thinking maybe I'd just stay away from the coffee. It's not much better. For some reason both the coffee and iced coffee have a horribly bitter/I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-it taste. It's not a flavor in coffee with which I'm familiar. And I've worked in two coffee shops and been drinking coffee since long before I should have started.  I'll admit that while I do appreciate certain coffee more than others, I'm able to appreciate/stand pretty much any coffee, anywhere. I had to throw out my almost-full iced coffee, and the others I drank more of basically because I was there with a friend, I paid for them, and I knew that they weren't going to make them any better. But I didn't finish any of them.  I'll also agree on the comments about the attitudes of the service. I often feel like I'm an inconvenience to them.  The only reason I keep coming here is because I meet a friend about once a week, and she likes this place (for the mojos) and it's a good in-between meet-up. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to request a new meeting place.  If you're in the mood for tea, however, go for it. Even if you're not...go for it. ", 1.0 star rating ,1,LOW

Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second coffee on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again.

If you like to spread out when you study, come here. -Usually you can find a place to sit at the seatings, bar or couch -Love the hipster vibe and vibework  Cons: -This place is COLD. I don't mean kind of chilly bring a sweater. I mean after one hours your fingers will be ice and you will be chilled to the bone despite wearing a peacoat. The best seatings are lined up on the wall and the air conditioning blasts right on them. Sitting at a seating that isn't on the wall helps but definitely doesn't solve the problem. Every time I come here I bring a sweater, but nine times out of ten I have to leave before I planned because I couldn't stand how cold I was. If you're a small or naturally cold vibe, DO NOT come here or plan to be here for more than 30 minutes. Earlier this morning it was 50 degrees outside and they still had the air conditioning on -- I left earlier than I wanted to.

Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    coffee was apparently the best one my g/f had ever vibed.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.

It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging hours like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 vibe in here and one lonely service trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.)

Usually they only have one vibe working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's food's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why vibe are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell food (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hoursly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a coffee & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvÌ©e that is used for coffee. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy coffee, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the service will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has parkinged in behind me.

Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is CuvÌ©e in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the service members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they parkinge about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a vibe instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve CuvÌ©e coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally location to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the service said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same service parkings to our seating with a slice of foodcake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of foodcake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

This is another version of the ever so popular, hours 24 hours coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not hours 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to location. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside seating is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent vibe, vibe on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the piÌ¬ce de rÌ©sistance) the incredible Strada coffee machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club food.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the vibe there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great vibe, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

A few notable bad vibes:  - Standing and waiting for the service to serve me, even though there was no one else in line.  I had to finally say ""excuse me, can I get some service?"" to get said service to do his service. -  Ordering a coffee, only to find -- they're out of coffee.  This has actually happened a few times.  I had to wait for them to coffee a fresh batch. -  Some days, the coffee tastes like watered-down swill.  Other days, it's delicious.

When I got there, nobody was at the counter for me to order but he popped out from the back after a bit and apologized. Genuine smile, so, of course, he was forgiven.  I always get the Mexican coffee or an iced Mojo from Epoch so I got the Mexican coffee to see how this one compared to the original location. Crazy tasty!

It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop hours up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater seatings good for those on a date or (as most vibe were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater seatings in the back. It also seemed that they had a back seating.  Small selection of food from Russell's food. They also have a kitchen that makes food and foods from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect.

(Yes, I know Genuine coffee's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are seatings, benches, sofas, comfy seating, plentiful internet...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the service and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y coffee so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a food unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.

They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) coffee usually include a beautiful coffee-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of food, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to food on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

I didn't know that until I saw the alcohol taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the location - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying hours until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those food & foods, and their colorful matcha-infused coffee. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff.

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable seating). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, internet  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow vibe (the background vibe can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one parkinges. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the seating in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The vibe is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink price are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as food and foods.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The service do a good service maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffee, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of vibe, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Pros: vibe seatinging vibe General vibe Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively bad price Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the vibe, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine coffee down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the vibesy/design vibe having a collaborative meeting.)  The service is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no internet to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of vibe?  seatinging is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella food ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The food is a great idea but the food itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the food crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The food itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a coffee and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not good price. The foods range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, vibe-watch, or read books. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and vibe, the vibe, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar vibe, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. foods and pop tarts...and alcohol? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also coffee coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big seating, little seating, bar seating, regular seatings) is both delightful and refreshing. The service make foam vibe - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful vibe - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double coffee with tonic water.

We wanted to try their delicious looking foods and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to coffee.  We both ordered the Nutella food and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous vibe and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The food is basically half a food, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The food itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the food. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella food and a fried food food. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other foods, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger vibe and there is definitely no place for high seating. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of seating games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have food with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!

It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated price and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall.

Not a great place for a date or to meet a friend - very cute vibe (props to the designer), but vibe is a bit all over the place, and for the price I would go somewhere else. Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed vibe of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay hours till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a alcohol/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.

I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the seating and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude vibe inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful vibe.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very bad price for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.

As customary to any vacation we go on, I try to find a hipster coffee place to go to- mostly because, well, I like my coffee (I think someday, it may give me an ulcer, but until then, I'll continue to drink it.)  After spending a few hours in the Texan sun (which definitely drained me), a nice cup of refreshing coffee sounded good.  We stopped by Houndstooth- a modern hipster place. I got the Japanese style iced coffee- I've had it before, and was pleased that it was offered here.  It was smooth and refreshing- and to my standards, I did not have to add milk/cream of any sort, - meaning the aftertaste was light and worth drinking black.

It's a beautiful and unique cafe nestled under a bank and office building. You can tell that they take their coffee making seriously because I have never seen anyone weight out the exact amount of coffee, time the exact amount of time the coffee should coffee, and then serve it to you. Everything was done with so much detail and precision that I thought I would get the best tasting coffee in the world. What I got was definitely rich but it was also really weird. I ordered the Japanese iced coffee and it was like a mix of green tea with coffee. The taste is definitely deep and multi-dimensional but there was a weird after taste. I wish they would develop this into some type of iced coffee that is sweeter because I think it was taste a lot better. This is definitely a place for those who appreciate their black and dark, rich coffee. I guess for me, it just didn't hit the spot. Japanese ice coffee ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

If I had time to drink-in I would have tried the interesting sounding ginger coffee drink of the day with decaf coffee, but that was a drink-in exclusive and I needed to go to a meeting.  I also asked about their coffee but they're mostly high coffee.  So I went with a decaf coffee.  I can respect that some coffee houses want to have only natural sweeteners.  All that they had out was raw sugar.  But, I really need to avoid adding sugar for health reasons, so I would have preferred to have my sweeteners of choice available (Splenda or Stevia).  Since I had no choice I used the sugar and it took a whole lot of raw sugar to sweeten the coffee to even a fraction of the sweetness I usually enjoy.  I try not to think of how much sugar that was.  But, it tasted good.  If I lived nearby and could keep a box of splenda on my desk, I'd be happy to get coffee from here again and sweeten it myself.  Unfortunately since I'm only here on business, I'm better off sticking to the generally inferior Starbucks so I can have coffee w/o tons of sugar and have it be at the sweetness that I like.

No question at all.  service are nice if you know them. I don't and they are still polite, so we are good there too! In fact we are moving along just fine...  But then, I have a conundrum. Let me set the mood: 9am on a weekday, very few vibe in line (2 ahead of me, to be exact). The two in front are extremely curious about the menu, the different flavors and options. There is a service listening to the two chat about the coffee options for the day, and another service at the register. Today I just wanted foods. Just a couple of foods, and I will be on my way. Nothing more. Please PLEASE don't make me wait out these two coffee-curious patrons ahead of me. Please...? So I wander over to the service at the register thinking I could sneak in a food-only order. service #1 wouldn't allow it. ""Back in line, sir."" Even if the two vibe in front of you haven't even decided what to get yet, you need to wait. Please, just wait. So I waited. But do I really need to wait? Can we rethink this? Bend the rules a little? Have some compassion and creative thinking beyond the prescribed establishment rules? Maybe...create a food-only line!? (Go to Black Star Co-op and see how they do it. Brilliant.) At any rate, no notch on the stars for that. It is what it is. Just think there could be improvements there.  It's very bad price. Really good, just very bad price. And no food line. UGH!

I tried the iced coffee, coffee, and pour-over, and all three were the best I had in Austin.  I'm not sure what coffeeing method they used for the iced coffee, but it tasted like cold coffee -- low in acidity. I liked it significantly better than the one I had at Dominican coffee (which is also a competent coffee shop).  The coffee shot was sweet, and a little tart without getting into the silly levels of sourness that so many 'cool' coffee shops seem so fond of.  The pour-over was a delicious Burundi, roasted by North parkingolina's Counter Culture Coffee, and coffeeed on a Kalita Wave. (The Aeropress madness seems to have mostly bypassed Austin.) This was my favorite of the three drinks.  I did not try the milk drinks, but I did see them make a coffee, and the milk appeared to be correctly steamed and poured.  Houndstooth is a multi-roaster cafe; in addition to Counter Culture, I saw beans from PT's Coffee (Kansas), and some Texan roaster whose name escapes me.  In addition to coffee, they have food Deli food foods, the usual coffee shop food, and I think I saw loose leaf coffee. price were maybe a shade higher than similar shops in seatingtle, with the coffee shot running closer to $3 than $2.  Note: this place is nearly invisible if you're parking down Congress, unless you're specifically looking for it (which you should be).

It certainly doesn't feel like much of a privilege to stand around in an inexplicably un-airconditioned shop (seriously. is it broken or is having no a/c part of your campaign for street cred?) sweating and blearily watching some nervous kid do prayers and gyrations over coffee coffee for the better part of 30 minutes.  I get and appreciate the parkingeful preparation of a quality product, but I feel that Houndstooth has overshot the mark and landed in Portlandia territory.  Houndstooth is fully equal, coffee-wise, to their competitors, yet they are more of a hassle, and more bad price.  Why would I ever do this to myself again?

Since it was cold coffee coffee, it tasted very different from iced coffee prepared in the traditional way with hot water. Give it a try if you want a different vibe from regular ice coffee. You may like it.  The service at the counter was extremely nice and patient when I asked about how the coffee was prepared, etc.  The vibe is quite pleasant and relaxing.

The space is much larger, and the colors are warmer than its counterpart on N. Lamar, but you get the same, excellent coffee.  You can choose between the aeropress and the clever coffeeper as your method of choice, and you can still pick between two different beans. Gregory, the service working at the time, was really friendly, and I also saw him patiently (and excitedly) explain the different coffee choices to others who came in. Kudos to you!  What I did love about this location is the vibe. It's very bright and hours with plenty of seating. I came on a Saturday, which is typically less busy than the rest of the week since the usual business vibe aren't working.  There are only two cons to this location for me: 1) It's location, so you're gonna have to price for parking. 2) They have keys for the bathrooms here - I hate it when coffee shops do this, it's like begging for germs to be spread since vibe don't always wash their hands. The service will touch these keys as well..I hope they get cleaned. This is me being a germaphobe.

I was on a fifteen minute break from work and had already waited in a long line, so I just had to bite the bullet and price. Also the main service was completely ridiculous. Every time I asked him a question like ""Is that a medium?"" or ""How many shots come in it?"" he'd give me some condescending response (without even looking up at me) like ""I only do one size,"" ""I always do two shots,"" as if I should've researched all of the Houndstooth policies before coming in. Don't get me wrong, the coffee was good, but not at all worth the wait, the nauseating service, or the price. Also I'm really confused as to why it keeps getting described as ""cozy.""

I would even go as far as to say she was downright rude.  If you've never been there before it's extremely confusing and even if you're standing right in front of her she wont acknowledge you until you just tell her what you want. As you can imagine, if you dont even KNOW what you want this can be frustrating. She didn't even look up at us when we quite obviously parkinged up to the counter right in front of her. The weird part about it is there wasnt a menu even posted so when I parkinged up to her I actually needed help. She didnt say one word and I just looked around until I found something that looked like a menu. That is definitely not how I want to start any day. Obviously, I havent HAD coffee yet (since I'm there to receive my java fix), please dont piss me off this early...  The coffee was good which gives this place one star and the vibe was nice which gives me the other 2 stars.

The service wasn't that helpful in helping me to figure out what to order, but it seemed like he tried by asking if I had any questions and describing some of their selection.  The place, service, and cost, is good, not great. It was bad price and I parkinged away regretting the extra 15% tip. I wouldn't return, because I just wasn't that impressed.

I love the vibe, the location and the workers here. Coffee variety is pretty interesting, they have many unique drinks a place like Starbucks would lack.  My one complaint is that with so many unique drinks they also fall kinda short on some typical coffee flavored like hazelnut. On top of that, some of the specialty drinks can be a little pricier...  But it is at the base of the frost bank tower, one of the nicest buildings in Austin and near a lot of financial corporate organizations. My point is, vibe are willing to spend a little more money.

It's so refreshing to finally see an amazing local coffee shop in a great location.  Having only been to this location once and on a Friday, I don't know if my vibe was typical. Given my vibe with their location on Lamar, I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of fooddeli food food, get here early. When I was here just after 8, they had already sold out of most of them.  I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas.

Hopefully when the remodeling and construction is done there will be seating inside and somewhere to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and possibly check out the bikes.

There is a small coffee bar inside that 1 or 2 vibe can sit at. Other than that, it is just a small coffee machine, am extremely friendly coffee maker and an iPad to check vibe out on. I love how simple it is.  This is definitely a place for coffee enthusiasts who don't need a bunch of syrup and flavoring put in there coffee. We had we both a Mexican coffee which was amazing. The flavoring was just right but it did not overpower the flavor of the actually coffee. The gentlemen working was so nice and was kind enough to discuss places we should make sure to go to and how to handle SXSW.  All in all we had a great vibe.

I don't know how she did it, but the milk was almost foamy, even though it was iced. Sounds weird but I promise it was amazing.

I mean that in the best way possible. Every morning you can see hipsters making their pilgrimage to Flat Track. Bearded men and tattooed women alike bicycle, scooter, and hike by the droves to flat track for their daily dosage of coffee; you can set your watch by it.  Their popularity is no coincidence neither. Flat Track has incredible attention to detail. They roast their own beans and the proof is in the pudding - they serve some of the best coffee in town. I typically order a coffee - their coffee is done well and their coffee vibe is always on point.  My only complaint is that this place can sometimes feel a little too ""scene-y"". Its a tiny little shop and everyone seems to know one another. My suggestion is where a jean or leather jacket and strike up conversation with the service real quick, before they realize you're not part of the club ;) .  But in all seriousness, the coffee is great. The vibe there are nice. I only wish it was a little bit larger space and felt more inviting. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

My take...  Overall: love the taste of their coffee, cool industrial design, friendly service. Limited seating. 8/10  -coffee quality: fantastic coffee. Mild/medium roast with a VERY smooth finish. No much bitterness at all. Disclaimer: I ordered an coffee with a small amount of hot water.  -coffee choices: limited. No fancy Starbucks  menu or syrups. Just coffee, coffee, coffee. Can get them on ice. But this isn't really a negative thing. They focus on coffee and do it well.  -seating: VERY limited. 5 metal bar stools at a single counter. This is the one reason it's not a 5star for me. After talking to one of the services, I understand they don't intend to be a large, ""stay while"" kind of shop. More geared towards grab-n-go or, according to the service, the opportunity for one-on-one convos with the few vibe who do stick around. One single, two-outlet plug.  -wifi: nope.

They currently crank out two beans for patrons to drink, and the storefront is as low maintenance as it gets. Tucked on a side street right off of Cesar Chavez and I-35, no sign draws you in. You gotta be ""in the know"", which makes me feel all the more hip; unfortunately, I do not ride my bike into the Eastside. The storefront has a couple of stools and a coffeeing station, and that's about it--it does not need more. It provides enough space to have a great conversation.  The two bags in stock, for your home-brewing purposes: Colombia Finca Miranda and Rwanda Dukunde Kawa. The former lends itself to a vibrant, clean taste, not unlike citrus. The coffeer affords the drinker a more full-bodied cup, with more distinguished fruit nuances.  At less than $20 a bag, these beans will definitely get you going for all of the fantastic pricing, good service, and heartfelt roasting that comes along with purchasing a bag.  Oh, and I felt super hip buying one of their $5 hankies/bar towels. I don't know if I actually have a use for it in my household, but why the heck not? It is branded with their logo. Homebrewing.

It compares favorably to Cafe Medici and Houndstooth, which to my palate are the best in town.  Flat Track roasts its own beans at a location in south Austin and it shows.  I believe the vibe in charge of roasting used to be a general manager at Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco.  You can also buy beans from them; you can't beat fresh roasted without any shipping delay.  They favor a medium roast, which I strongly prefer because it tends to better balance and present a wide range of flavors in the roast.

One of my coffee service/connoisseur friends brought me here and introduced me to what New Wave coffee SHOULD and CAN taste like.  No bitter/burnt after taste at all - good coffee shouldn't need sugar.  Genuine and vibeable service who invest in the vibe of coffee - good vibe!  It's a very small shop - a few bar seating and the rest is standing seating.  Not your typical coffee shop where you go and bring your laptop and books, but I think that's part of the charm since the focus is primarily on making you that good coffee.    Whole milk is used for the hot steamed milk and do expect a cute little coffee heart vibe:)  If you are new, there is no menu when you parking in.

Double Check Babe-alicious service with awesome hair and a great dog? Triple Check    Flat Track has it all. Tucked away in a strange, curated bookstore, this exceptional caffeination station service up hands-down the best coffee you can get on any block in Austin (the block has a few coffee places on it, with another having just sprouted up down the street, all of which pale in comparison to the energizing elixir the coffeein' betches at the fabulous Flat Track perfectly produce). To coffee their beans, they employ a nuclear physicist/mad scientist named Amanda who rides a motorcycle and has a pet alligator.    The bookstore--who's name I don't even know, so I like to pretend it is nameless for edginess' sake--will provide all the intellectual stimulation your brain can possibly absorb while you sip away at the best $%@&ing coffee this side of the Mason-Dixon. For all you boys out there: if you want to take your tinder date to a great spot pre day-bone, look no further than this local-owned Austin classic.    Some vibe say it is hard to find, so let me make it easy for you: On the easterly-facing wall of the no-name bookstore mentioned erstwhile, there is a huge mural of a boy who has frozen to death reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest.

The food goods look good, but I haven't sampled any. I have sampled the parkingamels, which are super good. A small coffee will run you about $4. Not good price, but way better than the good price stuff. Also I have to confess that I love the aesthetic of their cups.  Almost no seating inside. This is not a place to come whittle away hours on the innernet. It is a great place to stop by, grab a cup, and go. The location inside of No Comply is really interesting, too, and if you were to linger by the window seating for a while I'm sure you'd see some interesting things. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The service are always kind, but the quality of coffee is incredibly variable. I've had good shots and I've had shots that taste of grass and cigarettes. I've had quite a few of their whole beans which apparently are roasted by Barrett's, not themselves, which was interesting to hear. I've had solid Rawandan but also a burnt Kenyan AA. Consistency of quality is a hallmark of good coffee and cafÌ©s and Flat Track unfortunately misses more often than it hits. Their signage and space are beautiful, though.

There coffee is extremely dark, rich, and woody without tasting the slightest bit burnt or bitter.  Serious coffee fans will love this place; all others, probably not so much.  This is exclusively an coffee bar, and their coffee is not just the main attraction, but the only attraction.  The space is very nice, but tiny.  It's also (perhaps intentionally?) very difficult to find.  They have no signs.  The mural on the side of the building is what pointed me in the right direction.  The nondescript entrance definitely makes it feel that much more special, like you're in on a fantastic little secret to which the rest of this too-hip-to-function location is oblivious.

The Vanilla coffee tasted like it had wayyyyyy too much syrup and it was super milky with no coffee in it. Dirty Chai coffee was probably the worst I've ever had in Austin. It didn't even taste like it had an extra shot of coffee in it. I was not a fan of this drink. food food = were pretty basic and didn't impress. I see why they only charge $5 for their food food.

I found Mary's on Yelp and we headed over there - it's near UT so we were a little worried it might be crazy vibeed with students but we were there at 9am on a Sunday so it wasn't bad.  It was getting sort'of busy by the time we left at around 9:45 but we parkinged right up and ordered.  I went with a banana peanut butter smoothie and ordered the red velvet food.  My friend ordered their sweet food which consisted of wheat food with cream food, sliced strawberries and honey.  My smoothie was good but had too much peanut butter for my taste.  The warm red velvet food was delicious with a dollop of sweet cream food and drizzle of chocolate and raspberry.  YUM.  It took a good 10-15 mins or so to get our food but it wasn't a terribly long wait.  I can see how they back up during busy times because there were about 10 vibe waiting when we left and if it took 10+ mins for each of their orders that can create a back-up!  I used the bathroom before we left and found a cute unisex bathroom down the hall that was neat and tidy.  Good location in a small shopping strip with some parking right in front.  They had some yummy food and other food options that I'm sure are pretty good. Cute and tidy bathroom down the hall. Red velvet food. That's sweet cream food with chocolate and raspberry drizzle.

Although being parking distance from UT location, I never knew this place existed until a friend brought us here.  Driving or parking by, you can't miss their sign out front and their interior vibe is just as interesting.  It's a small place with booths at the window, several small seatings, and a couch.  What a place appropriate for Austin!  Their menu covers foods, coffee, smoothies, food, foods, and foods.  Seriously, all food places should have a sampler dish available!  Their foods looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige food with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries.  Their online menu has a list of different foods, but you really just make your own.  First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small.  Don't worry, it isn't.  I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh.  The food was a bit dense for me, so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it.  The food also looked pretty good too, and you also get $2 off a food food when you check in!  Missed out on their food Pops too, so another excuse to come back.  There's only one or two cooks, so the food will take a while to come out.  Make sure you're not in a rush.  I was the last of a group of 8 to order, and my food took about 30 minutes.

I eat here about once a month, so I would consider myself a semi-regular, but not a regular-regular.  What would make this place 5 stars?  Better serviceing/scheduling. Often only 1 vibe working during food rush, sometimes 2 vibe = slooowww service... I've learned to call in my order 15 min before I come, but for those of you who don't: there could be a long wait (15-30 min for a food food). The nice thing is that everything is made to order, which makes it delish... but that wait can kill someone's food break really quick.  Also, this seems petty (and it is), but I don't like that they are categorized as ""Miscellaneous Food Stores-Conv. Stores, Markets, Specialty Stores, and Vending"" under their Square/card processing services. It messes with my bonus points. Where I might normally get 2% or 5% back for using my parkingd at a restaurant/dining establishment, I only get 1% here because they've categorized themselves as a food store/market. Boo to that.

They have an array of healthy and not-so-healthy options. Avo/Queso food is super tasty, fresh and simple. Lately, I've been getting the 'make your own food food' option. Super good as well -- especially the ciabatta food! One of my friends I dragged along not too long ago had a food and she said it was also tasty. Highly recommend their foods if you have a sweet tooth. They have a lot of options and usually have some featured food special. Last time I went it was a churro food!  As far as price, I think it's super reasonable. A lot of the time vibe don't realize that small businesses don't have all the luxuries of larger restaurant chains. So don't except super good price price but instead expect reasonable price that reflect the quality of their food. You can easily have a food here for $10 - $12 max. Probably, less if you don't get extra stuff.  Wait times are on the long side. Again, a product of being a small business. It can especially get lengthy if they have more than a few vibe being served. It's a tiny place, and they usually only have two vibe working. They don't have a true kitchen so this also adds to the wait time. However, I think the food is completely worth the wait!  I only have two/three gripes with this place....  For one, I noticed that my order is made differently (and I'm not talking about taste) depending on who makes it. Sometimes my food is fooded and some times the foods are actually cooked over easy. Sometimes I get chips, sometimes I don't. Not a big deal. Just being nit picky.  Two, one of the guys working here is a bit stand offish and comes across a rude at times. Not a big deal as I'm not coming in for a social vibe, but a little kindness goes a long way. And I'm not social by any means, so it's not like I'm trying to parkingry a conversation.... think I read in one of the reviews that this problem has been fixed.  Third, the hours can be VERY inconsistent. This probably one of the only major flaws with the place (it's not even that major). About 50% of time I've been here, it has been hours despite the displayed hours. Again, I do understand that it is a small business, but there needs to be some more consistency. It seems to happen often around foodtime (which is when I usually come). I know that they sell out of stuff sometimes and they don't have a lot of service. I highly recommend you call ahead to see if they're hours (during non traditional food hours).  All in all, exceptional food, plenty of options, quaint vibe, and reasonable price.

This is a pretty cute place, and sort of in a very random location near location - I never would have noticed it if my friend hadn't told me about it.

I heard the story of who Mary is from my friend, and it's super touching - ask the service next time you're in!  I tried the food here, and it was pretty good - they handmake all of their food in the store. The chocolate chocolate chip is rich and delicious. The mint chocolate chip and coffee flavors are a little bit lacking in flavor. The food has a really ""sticky"", pull-apart texture, almost like eating food batter, which I find to be interesting!

Seriously?  Yelp to the rescue.  I think there were 8 or 10 different flavors of food.  And granted, this wasn't just your plain old raspberry, vanilla, chocolate, whatever.  This had character.  The raspberry was mixed with homemade ladyfingers.  Yum!  And the vanilla was mixed with their homemade chocolate chips.  There was even popcorn with the yummy stuff from Cornucopia next door.  I can't remember all of them, but they were delicious.  I decided on the Fruit Loop (raspberry with ladyfingers). It was delicious.    My date had the vanilla chocolate chip food (can't remember the fancy name) & one of their homemade chocolate banana foods.  OMG was it good.    This place is still pretty new (open a couple of months) & their selection is growing. I think I'd like to try one of their food options next time.

They are hours on Sundays through July... that breaks my food lovin heart - but they're beyond awesome, other than that. Ken, the service has got to be one of the hardest working, food love giving, awesome vibe playing, food pop making folks out there!

They're LiÌ¬ge foods and, until you have LiÌ¬ge foods, you haven't had the best.

Oh, Mary's has got that covered, honey... there are grilled wraps that are mouth watering delish, as well as lovely foods. Oh, and that food I told you about that Ken makes?  Yeah... that is the stuff my kids fight over.  The food pops are just too srumdiddlyumptious to even think about not having... and having every flavor over time.   All in all, Mary's is my go to spot for any food of they day and I know it'll be fresh, made from scratch and made with so much foodie love that the foodie angels sing praises from the parted clouds above.

So when I was a fat kid, I learned to do three things really well:  1. Make vibe laugh. 2. Field strip, clean, and reassemble a Colt Government M-1911 .45 ACP. 3. Sit & shoot a pencil out of my stomach, with unerring accuracy, up to seven feet.  The point is I'm deadly serious now about food & sweets, because I'm acutely aware of what I consume these days and how often I consume it. And also, fat kids may be all smiley and laughing around you, but what they really want to do is blow your brains out. This may be TMI.  But it does segue nicely to Mary's Pop Shop. Unfortunately when I was there, the actual ""gelato pop"" portion of the menu wasn't quite ready yet, although it should be in place by the time you read this. But there were four types of food available, with three kinds of giant food/cookie concoctions, which all looked good but exceeded my calorie calculations. So I went with a tarragon food food food. And it was a really good tarragon food food food. Huge breast chunks, grapes & pecans? Subtle mayo spicing & celery? Yeah, that works for me.    It also appears to be a one-man operation, with him doing everything, and his website story is touching. The shop itself is cool. The coffee smells great. I'm curious now about the morning ""Breakfast food"" specials, and how slammed he'll be during peak hours. But what impressed me the most was when he took my money, gave me change, but then washed his hands, put on gloves, and made my tarragon food food food. You know stuff we take for granted? Don't.  So right now, I'm a fan of Mary's Pop Shop, and I haven't even tasted the food yet. My instinct here is to let the newness diffuse a bit, let the tweaks settle in, and give this place a chance to catch its breath. And then pop in for a food update. I'm calculating the moments. New Belgian food, and a signature food pop, strawberry shortcake style... food food food. Unexpectedly great! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

We redeemed the Yelp offer of $2 off food food and one friend and I added food and the second friend added sausage for $1. We all enjoyed the food, they were very fresh (in fact we could see the guy making it from start to finish behind the register). We originally came thinking we'd get one of their famous food pops for food, but alas we were informed that the freezer had broken the day before and many of their pops had melted.

My mom ordered the turkey food wrap with iced tea and my dad ordered the peanut butter pig foods and coffee.  We figured we covered a little something of everything.  When the food came out we quickly took tasting turns and everything was so yummy!    It's amazing that food would taste so good with bananas and peanut butter cream food on the foods.  The food turkey wrap was full of flavor and the tortilla wrap wasn't rubbery or heavy tasting.  The food food had a perfectly cook food, not too soft and runny and not to hard and crumbly, but just right.  The food and queso gave it a buttery type taste especially on the lightly fooded multi grain food.  The coffee was delicious, I didn't even have to dress it up because of the flavor.  The iced tea was excellent and had a minty taste.  The services are perfectly sized to make sure you leave seating for food by the cup or a pop.  The peanut butter and jelly pop was very delicious.

That goes against my values. ""Life is short, eat food first""? THAT'S ME IN A QUOTE. But it happened at Mary's Pop Shop. I have pretty low standards when it comes to food, and I'll eat virtually anything sweet. I mean no disrespect, Mary, but this just wasn't worth the calories.  I sampled the sweet potato pie and the food chocolate, both underwhelming in taste. They only had 6 flavors, 2 of which were vanilla and chocolate. I think the bigger problem lies in the texture, which was icy rather than creamy. My friend shared his vegan Oreo with me, and it was actually pretty good, but of course lacked the richness that I like in my food.  Another friend had a birthday food food pop, which is their main selling point. Alternating layers of food and food molded into a shape of a popsicle sounds genius. Ngl, it looked adorable. But it was maybe 4 bites for $4. It can't be that laborious to justify a dollar per bite.  Am I missing something here? I wish I had gone to Dolce Neve... ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

It only hoursed a few months ago, but the service has already tapped into something special and our taste buds and vibeeries are smiling for it.  What is it exactly?  Well, a little bit of everything.  This is one of those joints that seems to do everything right.  I have never had food this good anywhere before.  The chocolate is my favorite of the regular flavors.  The service offers seasonal options as well which rotates on a fairly regular basis.  The pumpkin in the Fall was out of this world.  In addition, there are a great number of toppings that you can add to your food.  The coffee and coffee is as good as anywhere else in the city and compliment the food very nicely.  The wraps are tremendous.  The vegetables are extremely fresh, the foods cooked to perfection and the use of correct sauces with each wrap make every option a correct one.  It really makes you wonder how Jimmy Johns next door could even stay in business.  Once everyone working in the area learns about Mary's, I bet ole' Jimmy moves to another side of town because right now Mary is kicking his ass.  Lastly are the pops themselves.  I had no idea what to expect since my vibe has only been with store bought pops.  Comparing what Mary's sells to what you can pick up at HEB is like comparing fine dining to fast-food.  The pops are like a work of vibe with different layers of culinary pleasure to satisfy,  I've had the peanut butter and the strawberry.  I think they both made me moan in public like I was Meg Ryan.  The service is a great guy who is very cordial and helpful when trying to make your selections.  He always puts on gloves when making your food and throws them away as soon as he's done.  How often do you get to see that?  Finally, the story behind Mary's is pretty amazing.  I won't ruin it for you here, so I enourage you to stop by, order a wrap, grab one of the pamphlets that tells the story, kick back, read and then top it off with a pop/gelato and cup of coffee.  Your taste buds will be happy that you did. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I feel like I may have just ordered incorrectly.  I went into the cafe planning to order the food food food and ended up getting sucked into the Cubano.  Unfortunately, the Cubano turned out to be a poor choice.  The food was fooded poorly and it was rock hard (as in that raw feeling on the top of your mouth after you eat hard).  The meat was good but the pickles were not food & butter pickles.  A proper Cubano (at least how I always like/eat it) needs the food & butter pickles to add the sweet component to the food.  Instead, the food included dill pickles that just did not work with the rest of the food.  I also ordered the Nutella Strawberry food pop...as awesome as it sounds, it basically tasted like a flat half-chocolate covered strawberry ice cream pop...not nearly as enticing for the price.  All in all, I can understand the hype as it is a typical Austin place set near UT and although I am not ruling out another chance, the first time was definitely a miss. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

I finally found my way over on that side of town. Well, actually I drove 20 minutes out of my way to go to Mary's Pop Shop. I had a hankering for some true food. When I got there, I good locationly remembered that I had not had food yet. So I decided to have the food food with fresh sliced food, tomato, crumbled feta food, fried food on food. I love how everything Ken, the service and chef, makes is so fresh. Gosh, that food was so good. Remembering that I had come in for some food, (of course after I ate the entire food) I decided to get the gingersnap food with coffee food food. I ate it as I drove away, happily,with the Rittenhouse food, sitting next to me, that I was going to have for food. So, Yep, I pretty much ate food food and food with Mary's pop shop. The food was amazing, The coffee food in the food food was smooth and delicious. Eating while driving, was not the smartest thing I've done. But, dang, it was so good. When I got home I put the Rittenhouse food in the refrigerator and went to a couple of appointments. Later that evening, I had my Rittenhouse food. The homemade balsamic vinaigrette is fresh and perfect. The nice fresh mescaline greens with the candied nuts and cranberries mixed with the homemade balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect ending to my Sunday. I think I'm going to try to figure out a way to be on that side of town this week for a food pop. I can't get enough of this place.

The place could definitely use some work asthetically, but it doesn't look dirty or anything.  I got a make your own food food. The flavors weren't terrible but I wouldn't really call that a scrambled food. However, for the price I definitely would go elsewhere.  My gf got the sausage, red pepper, and food food on an everything bagel.  However, they were out of sausage (also out of food dough) (waffle dough?) due to the weather in the north east, so they replaced it with food. She thought the food was ok but she hated the food. It wasn't cooked very well. It seems like they are cooking everything on a food press from what I can tell. I assume that is why the food and scrambled food wasn't cooked well.  Maybe we just need to go back and try the food and the food since it seems like that is more what they are going for. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

They accepted my voucher and I bough an addition 5$ worth of food on top of the voucher and through in 2$ in the tip jar. 30 min had gone by with the shop not even that busy, maybe 10 vibe in the little shop. I went up to the front to address the clerk, a guy with short curly hair, to ask him very politely if the food was almost finished, he gave me the biggest fake, bull smile, and said really slowly OK. Later when I went outside to continue to wait, I hear him talking aloud all the guests and his co-worker about how this a#% hole uses a coupon and has the nerve to ask what's taking so long. Last straw, didn't even eat the food because he probably spit in my food. Don't eat this food unless you have an hours to spare. Not a pleasant vibe. ", 1.0 star rating ,1,LOW

Sadly, I was pretty disappointed and won't be back again.  I ordered the Honey Mustard food grilled wrap, which came with tortilla chips as a side (but no salsa... Wtf? Might as well serve it with potato chips). When I got the wrap home literally 5 minutes after the guy handed it to me (I took it to go because the restaurant is too awkwardly small to dine in), I hoursed the foil to find that it was barely even warm. The wheat wrap was faintly golden from the food press but the contents were COLD and the provolone food wasn't melted at all. Additionally, the wrap was coffeeping with honey mustard -- WAYYY overkill.  I think this place could be better with some minor improvements (salsa with the chips, less honey mustard, more time on the grill), but it certainly wasn't worth my money and I won't be going back.

The short of it is that their coffee was really good, the shop was super interesting but the counter service was complete disorganized anarchy, and they didn't have anything available to taste.  So, the long of this starts with my friend and I coming in on a Thursday afternoon. We enter this small unassuming coffee roaster - which of course, I looked up on Yelp. We try to find little vibeisan shops to go to and look at and support, and this one seemed perfect. As soon as we entered, we were enchanted by the lovely smell of freshly roasted beans, the thousands of coffee cups and coffee accessories lining with walls of the dark wood paneled shop, as well as the dazzling displays of candies and foods from what appeared to be Europe. Really, up front it was impressive. So, we took the time to wander the store from front to back - and as we did so, we started to sort of notice that there were a lot of vibe hovering around the main counter in this really disorganized fashion. They were ordering coffee, it appeared.  We hadn't been greeted by anyone yet, having been parking around the shop for a good 5-10 minutes, so we stood sort of in the middle of the shop, waiting our  turn for up at the counter. I had decided that I would ask a bunch of questions about their roasts and I was hoping that they would have tastings. Well, vibe were parking in all around us, we were super in the way - but there was nowhere else to be while we waited our turn. Several vibe pushed past us and went to the each side of us and stood there waiting for their turn - it was really chaotic.  After a few minutes, it appeared we were next. We stepped up to the bar-like counter and told the guy that this was our first time and I asked if they had tastings or what coffee he recommended, etc. He said that there were two coffee available for tasting, that were to the far right of the counter in large parkingafes, but otherwise they just sold beans. Ok... so he did ask me what types of coffee I usually like, (dark) and did have two recommendations - but they were out of the one he would generally recommend. So, I bit the bullet and I bought a half pound of whole bean of the Viennese Blend. By that time there was a lady standing next to us with cash in hand and vibe behind us as well. So, I felt rushed and took my coffee and stepped off to the side to try a quick sip of their coffee available to taste. They weren't labelled as far as I could see, so I picked one. It was unfortunately massively bitter - I'm not sure if it had been sitting there all day or not. Based upon that sip, this would be a two star review.  I did get home, and grind my whole beans and I am currently making my way through the half pound of the Viennese Blend and I actually very much like it. It isn't bitter or acidic and has nice balance. They definitely seem to have a lot of regulars and quite the following which is great. I'm awarding three stars - I'd really love to see more tasting options here, and better service for those who come in and it is their first visit. Otherwise, the coffee is solid and I'll probably be back to buy more. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

A little out of the way so you're not on a busy street, but in a really cute little shopping center with its own parking lot so it's easy to parking & parking around the other stores.  - The store itself is adorable. So many coffee cups, y'all. French presses, fancy coffee goodies, biscotti, you get the idea. They also have tea & accoutrements like tea pots, but I'm a coffee girl and I don't know much about all that.  - $1 cup of coffee. Let that sink in a second. They coffee one regular and one decaf roast each day and sell it for a buck a cup. This alone makes it worth stopping by.  - Excellent selection of fresh roasted coffee. I'm told they roast on Mondays and Thursdays so no matter when you go in you're getting the freshy-fresh. So. Many. Choices. Their menu board is well-organized & labeled. If you know what you like you can easily find it including fair trade & local. Also...  - Awesome service! Everyone was so nice & very helpful as well as extremely knowledgable. They can help you choose the best coffee for a given application (like, ""I want to be kickstarted in the morning and I use a French press."") They can also grind your coffee the ideal way for your coffeeing method of choice.  I kind of already can't wait to go back!

But a common thread, along with the obsessive love of clubs, pubs, and vibe is the coffee.  The best coffee available in PDX is Stumptown Coffee, also an old name for Portland.  When we were there Stumptown could only be found in a little hole-in-the-wall coffee mill on Division Street. vibe would line up out the door to get a bag of fresh roasted java.  Austin's equivalent, far as we are concerned, is Anderson Coffee on W. 38th.  Yep, Mozart's is darn good, but hasn't the variety and range of Anderson's fresh milled and roasted beans.  The quality is top-flight, with numerous varieties represented from most continents that grow coffee, particularly shade-grown Central and South American.  Price ranges between 11.99/lb and $14.99 for top premium.  The small shop, with its old, rough wood-grained floors, stained dark (coffee stains?) is not a place to hang out and dawdle over a mug, but to pick out confections of chocolate, imported candies and other treats, and nice little gifts for special occasions.

It's not a coffee house, where you can lounge around for endless hours on your laptop sipping a frappuccino. It's a place where you go to buy coffee by the pound or the half pound. They sell coffee by the cup, for a quite reasonable price of a dollar a cup! Score! I got the Guatemalan roast, which is earthy and crisp. The store has all kinds of accessories for your coffee and tea drinking needs- things like wild French presses, tea pots, chocolates to serve with your tea, finger foods, you name it. The coffee selection is out of this world! They must have had 20 different blends of coffee from lands that I've only heard of. They break down their menu by geographic region, which is pretty cool! The price are quite reasonable, considering the quality of the beans and the roast. The store is clean, and the service is quite friendly and helpful! parking was a breeze, as they have their own private lot, and there's a restaurant next door where they proudly serve Anderson's coffee, so if you wanna lounge around and sip your coffee, you can do it next door.

I was in a warm and fuzzy meeting recently and the facilitator was going around the seating prompting us for concerns. After several despondent financial and relationship stories it came to me, and my only issue and truthful response was I needed to get to Anderson's because I was low on coffee. Since I don't spend more than I make and actively work on my relationships, I just don't have a lot of angst to share.  Anderson's is one of those places that make Austin Austin. service seem to come and go, but their quality of beans, blends, and roasts have been consistent for me and their price are remarkably modest.  I'm not a connoisseur, I can't discourse on the legacy of Peet, but I can coffee some freshly ground Alfred's Blend that's just superb. I always keep their premium low-caffeine blend on hand.  Incidentally, I have nothing against caps and latts at Starbucks, I just get my vibeal unfettered coffee at Anderson's.

They have been known to shriek things such as, ""No, no you can't do that!!!!  You will bruise the beans!!!""  Or ""Ooooh noooo, we don't DO flavored coffee,"" with a look of disdain.  They cringe at the thought of buying pre-ground beans and they lament the fact that their parking's cup holders don't accommodate the parkingafe (yes parkingafe) of freshly coffeeed coffee that travels with them everywhere they go.  Pretentious much?  I'd say so.    Something else they are adamant about is buying their coffee from Anderson's.  As a kid, weekend activities such as softball games, birthday parties, and Girl Scout campouts were scheduled around trips to Anderson's (they are hours on Sundays so we had to make it on a Saturday, even if it was a very busy Saturday).  You would think growing up in this vibe, some coffee knowledge would have seeped through to me, but nope, I don't even know how to coffee a cup.  In fact, I'm quite intimidated by coffee and shy away from coffee shops.  I get nervous trying to order, afraid that I'll make some mistake.    One day I realized I needed to buy some coffee because I had house guests coming.  I went straight to Anderson's, and though I had some anxiety about ordering the wrong thing, the service was friendly and knowledgeable and best of all, not the least bit pretentious (ahem, mom & dad!).  parkinging in the door, it smells absolutely divine and there are all sorts of little knick-knacks.

They consistently produce a product worth buying.  I recommend branching out to try many of their beans, b/c they always deliver an excellent cup.  The other huge plus: their coffee is reasonably price.  I like to try local roasters when I travel.  I've seen beans up to $16 per pound.  Around Austin, the going rate seems to be $12 a pound.  But at Anderson's, you'll find most beans for a couple of dollars good priceer, although they have started parkingrying a featured bean that is usually $12 per pound.

They were ""doing"" coffee before coffee was cool...or, should it be, before coffee was hot?  Jamie Anderson learned his roasting skills from the paterfamilias of the American coffee  movement, that is, Alfred Peet, way back in the early '70s. For those who don't know, Mr. Peet taught lots of vibe the roasting vibe, and a few of his disciples migrated to seatingtle after some time in Berkeley, to sell Peet's coffee in that town under the name Starbucks.  Anderson's doesn't dive too deeply into the wacky world of single origin/estate beans, sticking to a proven variety of classic classics, and they just do those better than just about anyone...with 40 years vibe in this deep, rich cup, they were doing it before most of today's coffee hot rods were even born. The best part is, well, the second best part after the quality, is the price...shop around. I live in Portland where the ultra hip Stumptown runs 12-20 per pound...and up. And it's never, ever as good as Anderson's where the top coffee go for maybe 8.95 or 9.95 max. I think you can still get some varieties for 7.95!

While Anderson's product quality is still top tier I'd expect them to step up their customer service to keep shopping there a pleasant vibe. Two stars reflects the recent downward trend in service I've vibed. It all came to a head when I got a flat out no to a simple request from one of the bean clerks. A tallish short dark haired slender fellow who barely acknowledged me as a customer waiting for service. FWIW apparently their coffee bags are too precious to waste on a 1/4 pound of ground coffee. Maybe I'll bring my own paper bag next time to avoid being treated like an ass hole for a small request. However I don't think I should have to. , 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

My favorite coffee is their Dark Sumatra - it's very bold but never bitter - I start almost every morning of my waking life with at least two cups.  On occasion, when they've been out of the Dark Sumatra, the service has provided me alternatives which have also been quite pleasing.  Everyone that works there is very knowledgeable and most accommodating.   And when I've been unable to pick up coffee during regular hours, they've arranged for me to pick it up at Russell' s food next store.   How many business do you know that will do that?

I have been asking myself that lately?  All I know is that I am very parkingeful about trying things I love.  Because once I tasted the ""Premo"", I have a REAL hard time settling for anything less.  For example, a few years ago I went in to Andersons, bought an AEROPRESS (Awesome!) and a pound of beans.    Went home and experimented with my new coffee pump and I had cup after cup of the best coffee of my life.  I called my wife, tweaking out on coffee, ""OH MY GOODNESS THIS COFFEE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!   AHHHWWW I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS COFFEE IS  BAWWWAAAHHH!!!""  Now 3 years have passed by and I have this to say.  The Aeropress is mind blowing.  I always order an coffee when I am buying a cup of coffee from a local establishment, and I have had maybe three cups that are in the same dimension as what I can get out of that AEROPRESS.  Absolutely amazing!    While I used to think that it was the AEROPRESS that made any coffee amazing, I have learned that the AEROPRESS can only bring coffee to its full potential.  I have tried coffee beans from many places and NO BODY has coffee like Andersons.  It is so good that I will be at the grocery store, standing in front of the Coffee, completely out at home and my eyes will be swelling up with tears  looking at the sorry ass beans.  Looking and looking at all of the sorry bags of coffee. I used to really like some of the more bad price bags, but they all fall way short of Andersons.    So I tell myself ""SELF, if you buy coffee here, you wont make a point to stop by andersons, and every time you make a cup with theses crappy beans you will disappointed.  Go with out, and get to Andersons ASAP.""  So that is what I do.  I love Andersons coffee so much that I will go without coffee for several days until I can get the good stuff.  I love coffee, but now that I can have the best, that is what I want.  The best or bust.  If there is better coffee out there, I will try it.  Trust me I am looking!  But as of the last three years Andersons is the winner.  Java Panture and Italian Expresso is what i get the most often, but it is all good.  Also, the decaf is so good!  I used to think of decaf coffee as dirty brown water, or a pointless waste of time, but this Decaf is a delicious treat.  Okay so I am a snob about what I am passionate about.

I'm rather partial to the Red Sea Blend and Alfred's Blend.  The price is right, too, if you're used to buying bulk beans and not Folger's or Sanka. His coffee runs $9-$11 a pound. That's by and by good priceer than most of Central Market's stuff just down the road.  I've never had the customer service problems that have been described by others on this board. I can believe that they occasionally exist as it's a small business and not all small businesses subscribe to a doormat customer service policy.  But I usually have Mr. Anderson in his apron and bowtie service me. Or some cute young guy service up my beans. It's not unusual, even on a busy Saturday morning, for me to be asked three or four times if I've been helped while I'm in the middle of getting my order filled already.

In fact, i truly wondered, after some time without it,  how Anderson's would measure up. Fortunately, the answer is that Anderson's continues to meet and exceed my expectations, with great taste and quality. yum!  Anderson's coffee has several roasts rated highly as a ""cup of excellence"". Moreover, compared to the other coffee out there, Anderson's is  far more economical. Counterculture, Stumptown and Intelligentsia all sell 12oz bags of beans for over $12 whereas at Anderson's, a full 16oz is still less than $10. For a couple who goes through a large amount of coffee each month, this is important, and appreciated.  Anderson's sells many Fair Trade and local coffee.  A few years ago, Anderson's started offering coffee by the cup. When i was there today, i was happy to see they still offer it. A real treat, the coffee costs just $1 and is delicious, putting Pike's place to shame!  My favorite is the Red Sea Blend, but i really love trying all the different types.

Situated in the heart of location, you can find plenty of good price parking nearby so you won't have to dread parking a few blocks to get here. In all seriousness... parking in ATX is never a bad thing and I love the views of location.  This double decker coffee house not only has seating downstairs but a few community and small seatings upstairs. The drinks were good and was very happy about the availability of Hibiscus Iced Tea and their coffee variations.  The ordering of your coffee at this spot is a little different than most but it's very easy to catch on for us newbies that visit.  You'll want to parking towards the very back, past the first coffee bar you see. Once you order your drinks, your name will be called at the front coffee bar and then voila! A drink with your name on it (not literally, it's not starbucks) will be ready for you.  If you need internet they have it and yes it's free.  Drinks were very reasonable and the vibe was superrrr chill. I honestly was impressed with their vibe and got caught away when they started playing 80s vibe. Points for playing Eurythmics btw.  Austin's coffee scene has always been superb and I'm glad to have another spot on my rotation. The service was great and very vibeable which makes me want to go back on my next visit.

We stopped by Caffe Medici for some much needed coffee and to while away a half hours or so before heading to see the famous bats.  I liked the space and the iced coffee I ordered was delicious. The wait can be a bit long since they clearly try to perfect your order and perfection sometimes should not be rushed. If you were in a hurry, this could be very frustrating. However, as mentioned, we were trying to kill as much time as possible. Therefore, the friendly service's pace was not something that made us impatient.  We sat upstairs and tried to watch the traffic on Congress. It was not overly interesting, but this afforded us an opportunity to relax and not rush (which was what we mostly did during our Austin visit).  Caffe Medici gave us a chance to slow down, reenergize with amazing coffee and that was much appreciated. Until next time! Looking down Congress ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The last Sunday was nuts when they apparently did not have the coffee they listed but made a french press that was the color of dishwater and I wish it was dishwater, because it might have had better flavor.

There are few things worse than a good coffee shop that doesn't have anywhere to sit! The setup was a little unique, with orders being taken at one counter towards the back, while drinks are prepared at a larger central bar. I actually think this is a good idea as it probably reduces congestion during peak times as vibe wait for their drinks.  I was craving iced coffee so I kept it pretty simple. I was not at all disappointed. I usually drink hot coffee black, but iced coffee with cream and sugar due to its inherent bitterness. This iced coffee was barely bitter at all, and did not require much of anything to be added. Because of this I am assuming it is cold-brewed, which makes a huge difference.

As soon as I saw cyclists hanging out on the seating outside with their nice bikes on a Sunday morning, I had high hopes for this place. The coffee coffee (pourover via clever coffee) was very nice, though I'm not sure if it's the bean itself or the coffee that made a cup that soured unpleasantly as it cooled.

I've had their coffee, straight up regular coffee, and a shot os coffee. Every drink hit my coffee heart and had beautiful crema to top.

What about seating arrangements? And will the service act put out if you overstay your welcome?  I'm happy to report that CaffÌ© Medici turned out to be the perfect space for our needs. It's a popular meeting place for many in the location area, so talking while we worked didn't feel disruptive as the scene is already a buzz-y one. I especially liked the high chair seating around the perimeter of the central coffee bar - sometimes, it's just easier to work next to each other instead of sharing a computer screen across a seating. There's also an upstairs area if you're seeking a slightly more subdued vibe!  Coffee is outstanding - the coffee was smooth and robust; just the right temperature. If you're hungry, the menu isn't extensive but they do stock Greek yogurt, buttery foods and several varieties of foods.

I love coffee - I love the aroma that comes from a fresh cup, the strength and robustness that comes from a great coffee, and the beautiful coffee vibe that I feel awful for destroying the second I take my first sip. But Caffe Medici just doesn't do it for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love the location itself - very good location in location, really sleek and modern furniture, a great study space upstairs that is very conducive to getting work done (yay for internet!), a downstairs and seating area that are great for catching up with friends, and cool events that take place downstairs every so often (the last time I went there was a free salsa class downstairs!). It's so cute that I just want to love it so badly. But the actual coffee itself leaves me wanting so much more.  I usually stick to getting a coffee, however I've also had their black coffee, cafe au coffee, and their coffee. From my vibes, the coffee drinks just don't have the smoothness that I find at other coffee shops (ahem, Patika right around the corner), and their coffee lacks one of my favorite parts - the foam. I'm not sure if the milk is frothed at the incorrect temperature, but it just wasn't right. The black coffee was good, but didn't find anything special about it or its flavor and same with the cafe au coffee.  The drinks are also pretty bad price and are price similar to coffee shops that parkingry the highest quality coffee such as Intelligentsia and Stumptown. I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to price $4 for a mediocre coffee. I know the Medici family controlled the banking institutions in Italy, but a mediocre coffee shop is not going to rob this gal.

The service is always extra nice and polite, and they serve amazing quiche. Their iced tea is also pretty good. They have a lot of seatings and a seating outside with funky vibe. The vibe is also conducive to relaxation and/or casual work.  What I don't like about Flightpath is their coffee. This is a bit of a problem since the place is supposed to be a coffee shop. The couple of times I tried their coffee, the coffee either tasted scorched (first visit), or very watered down (second visit). This makes it difficult for me to justify coming back too often, especially when there are other amazing coffee shops nearby (*cough* epoch *cough*).  Another downer is that although the locale is fairly large, it's hard to find a spot as students (and professionals who don't want to work from home?) occupy all the seating and seatings. I get the first arrived, first served way of doing business, but the place isn't so useful to me if I have to fight for a seating every time I visit.  Flightpath is therefore a vibe spot to study and grab a food at, if you are lucky enough to find a seating. vibeally, I will be parkingeful to avoid their coffee on future visits as I've been disappointed twice already.

My coffee of choice has been their cafe au coffee, which has never ever let me down, and the service that serve it to me with full friendliness make the vibe even better each time I return. It may seem super random, but one of my favorite things about this place is that they don't have a standard set of coffee mugs.

Not only is there casual seating in the front foyer, but behind the bar there is additional seating along with a large number of internet for your devices, and beyond that, there is a good amount of outdoor seating - both a bar that overlooks Duval as well as picnic seatings and even more internet.  I think what impresses me most about this place is just how accommodating it is for large numbers of vibe, along with the fact that it just has so much vibeality. Outside, there are hanging lights with CD's as the backing, and a painted mural of outerspace. The seatings are vibeated with small designs and drawings which is super cute.  The interior features a large, body-sized mirror and two bathrooms, and the two 'rooms' of seatings are separated by a statement window-wall piece. It gives off a very hipster vibe inside with the colors and low vibe - perfect for getting work done.  Beyond just the general vibe, Flighthouse has parking in the back in addition to the spaces on Duval, and the service was extremely friendly and immediately made me feel welcomed.  I tried the coffee - which is interestingly served in a tall clear glass, despite being a warm drink. I wouldn't say it's my favorite coffee ever, but it was really good.

The vibe that frequents Flightpath always seems engrossed in their stuff so I don't feel like I'm being watched as I come and go (unlike at Houndstooth where it feels very much like a ""see and be seen"" type of place). And they have a mouthwatering assortment of food to satisfy any craving you might have.  The one bad thing is that their coffee is not the best. It's definitely not terrible but it's the worst of the three. (Houndstooth has seriously stellar coffee and Epoch is decent but sometimes served with a side of hipster.) I love the lowkey vibe and lovely service though, which I think makes up for it some.  I do like the parkingrollton (I think it's called). It's a frozen blended coffee drink. A little icy but refreshing and yummy on a hot day. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

As I sit here, sipping my tart cherry melon kombucha and munching on some jalapeÌ±o kettle chips, I'm reminded of two of the worst dates I ever went on. Remember La Condesa guy? Yeah, like that guy, but a different type of awful.  A few years ago, I went on my first online date. I wasn't sure how I felt about online dating, but I promised some friends I was going to give it a shot. Luckily for me, the first guy that agreed to meet was only free on the night of my birthday. I explained that my parents were coming into town and I'd be running a marathon that weekend, so I couldn't stay out late or do anything crazy. He suggested Flightpath because it was close to his house and you can never go wrong meeting at a coffee shop.  We met up, get in line to order, and he orders and prices for his drink and then looks at me expectantly. He tells me to order. I am all about equality - I am always willing to price for my own drink and I split the bill several times in the future on other dates. But this was different - there was no discussion beforehand. He didn't ask if we should split the bill. He just assumed. And on my birthday. If it had been on any other day, fine, but this was my birthday. I paid the $2.50 for my hot chocolate and then he commented on the fact that it was my birthday. The service then told me she would have given it to me for free if she had known. Oh, well. I appreciated her kindness, but my date's kindness was sorely lacking.  The date was boring and I left after an hours or so to meet my parents. I had an easy out and I was thankful. I didn't have much interest in any further dates, but I figured I wasn't being fair. I hadn't talked with him for very long and I left early - maybe things would have gotten better once he loosened up? Maybe he was nervous?  I am far too nice sometimes.  I agreed to a second date - we met at Flightpath to get coffee and then we were going to get some alcohol and some food and make a night of it. We order our coffee separately, of course, and then parking to Duval market to get some alcohol. While he is priceing for the alcohol, something amazing happens. He knocks his coffee over and it spills everywhere. All over the counter, all over him, some on the service - it was a coffee fountain that never stopped. I immediately started laughing - how could I not? I laughed so hard I was crying and my date was becoming increasingly more flustered. Now a line was forming and he was trying to hastily soak up the coffee with thin napkins, well aware that he was holding up the line. The more I watched him struggle, the more I laughed. He was now clearly annoyed with my laughter because he was embarrassed, but why couldn't he see how funny this was?  We left and ordered pizza - even though I mentioned I did not like pizza - and headed to pick it up. He made me price, stating that he purchased the alcohol. Alcohol I wasn't even going to drink. (I drank very rarely those days and he picked a alcohol I didn't like, so I wasn't really planning on drinking anything.) Now I was annoyed. What the hell kind of date suggests we do all this stuff and then just springs the pricement on the other vibe? He suggested East Side Pies and while I am very glad it led me to discover a type of pizza I'll actually eat, I was beyond irritated that we get there, parking up to the counter, pick up the pizza, and then he tells me, ""You have to price for it."" Um, what? This wasn't my idea, I told you I didn't like pizza, and you didn't ask me if I would price for it prior to us ordering! If he had asked, I wouldn't have been so irritated, but if he had asked, I would have suggested that we cook something together so I didn't spend over $20 on something I didn't even want to eat. (And he only price $8 on the alcohol that only he was going to drink. Clearly a man who believes in fairness.)  There were no further dates because I was done with that douche.  On the other hand, I am not done with Flightpath. Flightpath has been nothing but sweet to me. They make an amazing hot chocolate and I can't wait to order it once the weather cools down a little more. The vibe working behind the counter have always been so friendly to me and I love that. I've always found a spot to sit and I love their covered seating. And the internet - internet everywhere! internet for everyone!  That guy was a total tool, but he did introduce me to Flightpath and East Side Pies, so it wasn't a total waste. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The only downside is parking, since there are only a few seating in the lot and you have to parking a block away if you're going to stay, but the vibe and affordability is worth the short parking from 50th.

I think it's fair to say this one is overrun by students, but that makes for a vibe and concentrated vibe that I enjoy feeding off of. I have peace enough to read the Chronicle cover to cover, and sometimes leave a poem in my copy, hoping that some whimsy might loosen up one of these tense folks. The company is really the only con, contrary to what I said above, I know, but no one shows a sense of place here and interactions between strangers are limited, which can aggravate the seating issue (mentioned in other reviews) because most seatings can seating up to 4 but are occupied by 1-2. I grabbed a vacant middle seating on the couch once and neither the vibe on my right nor left said one word. As for the coffee, I can speak to the greatness of the Double coffee/Topo Chico, which I have ordered five times. $4.25 with the cash discount. It's worth mentioning that they have a nice selection of bottled drinks and packaged goods that you can peruse without holding up the line. The service are nice always, especially when you have exact change. Another note on service: it is fast. My order is pretty straightforward, but the menu isn't for purists. There's an array of milk and syrup options, so they have to whip up some crazy shit.

Dirty chai was great, vanilla coffee could have been stronger. Plate my bagel was on was dirty. Service was good-ish. Struggled to find a seating, shared a seating with someone, which is fine, I just preferred my own space.  Also, I fully realize this is totally a stupid preference of mine and it really shouldn't matter, but they served me my coffee, a hot drink, in a regular drinking glass instead of a mug. I just... look, hot drinks belong in mugs. I couldn't understand why I had a coffee in a drinking glass, yall. I saw many vibe with mugs but I also think I read a review about someone using their own cup, so I don't know if these vibe brought their own mugs or if they just didn't have anymore or what. It took everything in me not to ask them to pour my drink into a mug. I didn't because I would have felt stupid, but I wanted to. I know it's dumb but it bothered me a little.  I liked the layout and I will return because I can tell that it normally is conducive to studying/working and that it's better when it's less vibeed.

What differentiates this coffee shop from others is the background vibe. I have realized that the vibe here is not nearly as loud as it is at other local coffee shops. This makes studying exponentially easier.  The furniture and vibe have an urban and hipster vibe, but so do most local Austin coffee shops. However, I do like how seating the floor plan is. It allows for more seatings/couches and therefore, more seating for studying or socializing.  My favorite drink is the New Orleans Iced, which has a sweet coffee flavor to it. All of the food are from local vendors like fooddeli and East Side Pizza. Overall, I always find the food to be quite delectable. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

A customer had the balls to to say it was inappropriate for me to request a vibe change as it's ""not my place,"" to which the only reply is ""Fuck you. It's nobody's place but the service's."" The new service listened to my request for down-tempo vibe like they had been playing before (you know, progrock Rush is annoying as fuck too but at least it's inoffensive and not as fast-paced rhythmic) - ""I'll turn it down for you."" ""Oh, gee, thanks. I could also just blast my laptop at full volume to try to counter it. Let anarchy reign.""  Otherwise, place is full of:  Good wi-fi; good coffee; great seating; great outdoor access, generally great service with the service. But this vibe! I think it's the new girl (the other one is a very vibeal lady who likes dancey vibe, but this curse-laden rap is distracting as fuck when you're working in a public space). When I worked at a nice restaurant, one lady had the courage to write me a comment parkingd that said, ""Your vibe is too loud for gracious dining."" ""You're right! Fuck this shitty EDM in a fine dining joint."" My attitude persists - treat your vibe like they're the reason you have an unskilled service, and it's not an extension of your vibea to come from your little hovel on Duval to Flightpath to continue to bombard us with your shitty taste in vibe.

The pro's include: (1) tons of space to get a seating for yourself, (2) plenty of internet so you don't have to awkwardly ask someone else to unplug or share an internet, and (3) a friendly service (at least whenever I've been). What sucks: the parking situation, if you really want to parking in front of the shop. parking in the location and parking a few blocks won't kill you though. But we are here for the coffee. The cold coffee was very good, the coffee was ok (much better elsewhere). I've not been very excited by the munchy choices when I visited. Although I find there is generally an inverse relationship between the quality of the coffee and the number of food choices at many establishments. If you are looking for good coffee and a place to plug in, this is as good as any other venue nearby as far as I am concerned. If you want the very best coffee, you might want to wander elsewhere.

Really, I don't! I just don't want to talk to them. And I'd rather not hear them talking, either. Flightpath, or rather, an introvert's oasis, is the first coffee house I've ever encountered that encourages this preference.  Even though there is plenty of seating (including couches,) it's usually pretty full. I've had to do the initially awkward ""can I share this seating with you if I promise to be vibe?"" thing more than once. But that's the beauty of the coffeehouse: it can be vibeed and vibe at the same time! My favorite seating in the house are up front where the windows are. The back tends to be a little on the warm side, and natural vibe is nil.  As for the coffee,  I love love love their vanilla coffee. I don't know what they do differently, or if it's actually nothing special and I'm just enamored because I love the vibe so much, but whatever. It's great and I don't parkinge why.  Oh yeah, and if you do happen to be of the extroverted persuasion, there is a large back seating perfect for talking/socializing/hanging out/whatever you strange vibe like to do.

I discovered this place while laid off during the Government shutdown & if I lived in the area I'd be a frequent customer. What gives this place 4 stars is the attitude of the barrista when asking for a tea recommendation. I know that she ""wasn't a doctor"", but as a former barrista I know you're supposed to be able to describe your products. Luckily my vibe helped me pick the right tea but it still irks me...

This coffee shop is closer towards the grungier side--the furniture and interior is a hodgepodge of everything. The front of the shop is usually vibeed due to the lack of space but towards the back, they usually have more seating hours. Weeknights get pretty busy but I think during the morning, it's less vibeed. Another downside is finding parking in front of the store, it definitely can be a challenge at times. I usually parking two blocks away and parking to here.  Their food is usually imported from other local Austin establishments like East Side Pies so don't expect anything fresh.

In terms of hours-late coffee houses in the location area, Flightpath wins:  - large, comfy seatings that you can take up all for yourself and not feel like a jerk for (lots of solo parties here so you don't feel too bad), but at the same time share  without feeling awkward if someone comes in and asks if they can sit across from you  - internet everywhere, even outside  - inside has a large space divided by window panels, maybe I'm too trusting (in fact, yes this is probably it) but the transparency made me feel really comfortable leaving my laptop and using the restroom right around the corner (always the trust struggle when you go to work alone)  - note: very vibe, I don't know if i would go here for anything other than work  - they have good coffee on coffee, and their food slices are reasonably price ($4 vs. $6+ you usually see)  Four stars because parking is insane, and you need to go during a less busy window to find a seating/seat inside because while the seating is large and comfy, it is a smaller space compared to the other late night coffee houses (which is what makes it nice because it can never get too packed like the rest of them and they retain their quality seating), it will pack up real quick.

This place is a little ways from my house compared to Austin Java but I always find myself making the drive. Two reasons why: The place is vibe & they have lots of large seatings to spread out all my things. They serve a plethora of tasty food from cliff bars, to chips, to foods and even pizza. If you need a budget friendly mid day pick me while studying or working - they have lots of treats.  I never have an issue finding a place to sit and their WiFi is reliable. They have several couches and seating & an outside seating - this place is also great for a friend date. They only have a few seating out front so parking can be a bit tricky - free side street parking is available.  Tip: Get their iced tea and add peach flavoring - it's the perfect mid day food.

She explained that it was a service animal. First service wasn't comfortable but accepted it. The second service came over and told us to leave or go out on the seating. When informed that it was a service dog, he loudly asked her what her disability was.    I pulled him aside and informed him that it's not a legal question to ask. He rolled his eyes. Then said well, vibe see the dog and want to bring their dogs in.   I told him it's not cool to ask that. He said ""it's not cool to bring a dog in here""    After that we got the cold shoulder from the service.  While I love this cafe, unless things are going to change and service are informed on how to handle this situation, I'll have to go elsewhere to spend a small fortune in coffee.

It Happens, Rude, Blue-d and Tattooed Flightpath does a great service of making coffee, having wireless, putting up funky vibe and being vibe. It does not do a good service at others... like being friendly or having parking. I had a business meeting there today and here's the skinny:  I find the service downright surly. She's really pretty, funky style, dark hair, big feather earrings but sensed that i was inconveniencing her by asking for two prepackaged items: a diet coke and a fooddeli food. Neither requires any work -- but I felt like I'd asked her to do something highly complicated and inconvenient. An hours later, said service interrupted us to tell the individual I was meeting with that she couldn't have outside coffee in her ceramic coffee mug. (Mug? What do you call those containers with tops? Anyway). And then looked at Abby in disbelief when she assured her there was no coffee in it and stalked off. Dude, no one's bringing outside coffee. We're being green here.  I'm a pretty friendly vibe and I get that service vibe constantly is probably quite taxing, so typically I'm pretty chipper and grateful. But we were both struck by how grumpy this service is. Isn't coffee supposed to make vibe happy? The attitude on this lady screams ""angry bouncer"" instead of ""super coffee maker.""

I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but I do like good coffee.  I usually stick to basic medium-roast blends, and not a fan of vibeificially flavored coffee.  I recently heard good things about  Austin's Third Coast Coffee, and you could get it at Whole Foods in Houston where I live.  I finally found it at the Alabama/Kirby location in 12 ounce packages.    Just by the look of the package, you could tell it was local roasted and packaged.  When I picked up a package, you could smell the wonderful aroma of the coffee beans through the package...it smelled like heaven!  I looked on the bottom of the package and saw the coffee was roasted on July 23, 2013...and the date I was in Whole Foods was FOUR DAYS LATER...Saturday, July 27!!  No wonder it smelled so fresh!  I ended up purchasing the Columbia roast.  On the package you will find a description of the specific coffee roast, the batch lot number and the actual farm in Columbia where it was grown.  You can even trace your coffee on the Third Coast website.  I only drink coffee in the morning, so I couldn't wait until the next morning (Sunday) to try it.  Wow.  This had to be the smoothest-tasting, well-balanced coffee I ever had!  It was a true medium roast with a slight parkingamel, buttery taste that lingered on your taste buds after you drank it.  And I don't have a fancy-schmancy ultra-expensive or exotic coffee maker or grinder.  I have a ten year-old Krups ProAroma coffee maker, and a $20 Krups grinder.  When using freshly ground coffee beans, I do use Melitta #4 super premium natural brown cone filters (instead of the Krups gold filter) that doesn't leave sediment at the bottom of the pot.  The 12-ounce bag at Whole Foods sold for $12.49.  But when you consider it was just roasted four days earlier (in Austin) and how wonderful it tasted, it was well worth it!  I can't wait to try some of the other varieties! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

Third Coast Coffee is a shining example.    From their modest storefront, you'd hardly expect to leave with cherished black gold in a cup, but that's precisely what you'll get.  You may also come away with an thoughtful discussion, and make a friend or two, but that's just part of the total vibe that Third Coast has to offer.   They even gave my 6 year old son a lesson in coffee roasting on one visit, which not remotely the type of education you'll earn at your local Starbucks.  I luxuriated in several of their outstanding coffee before landing on the El Salvador, which is an intoxicatingly deep and satin-smooth coffee that sits on an entirely distinct, divine plane from other beans.  No matter how challenging my day may look in the morning, just the thought of this coffee (freshly ground and paired with my Aeropress) is enough to put a spring in my step and throw a sanguine outlook on my day.  If this all sounds like too much, then you probably just haven't had the chance for such an vibe yet through Third Coast.  I hope you do.  UPDATE 1/2/13:  I'm a scientist, so I love to experiment.  I had read raves about super high-end ""Bulletproof"" Coffee, which seems to be almost universally lauded.  Stuff costs $23 for 0.75 lb (with shipping).  So I tried it ( using my Aeropress, of course).  It was good, yes.  But the El Salvador totally BURIES it....at $9/lb.

Anderson's is okay, uses good price bags and relies too heavily on their location clientele. Other coffee roasters in town seem more like a business designed to turn a profit than a small company producing a quality hand-crafted product.    Two years ago, I was relieved to find exactly what I was looking for in a local coffee roaster - fair or direct trade beans, roasted according to the bean (not the roast), fair price (they're actually good price!) and someone at the counter that knows your face. I french press every morning and get excited when I have a fresh bag from Third Coast. I can't speak to the flavor note descriptions, but I know good coffee when I taste it and know my preferences. I skew towards Central/South American beans. I've bought their Guatemalan beans (try the new one!) more than most. The Mexican is light, bright and perfect for mornings - Kerbey Lane uses it. The Peruvian is delicious - they use it in the Briggo automated coffee machine at UT, where I work. When they have it in stock, the Nicaraguan is wonderful.  I recently moved from 78704 to Hyde parking and can't make it to their humble store front on South Congress now :( It smells incredible inside!

Third Coast Coffee just sounds a little sleeker. I mean, I can't even begin to comprehend where that term comes from or, much less, how to discern what it is referencing.  So, let's get down to business. This local roaster (you can buy the goods at the SoCo shop) cranks out a hodgepodge of caffeinated offerings. They roast all different styles and origins, but the hands-down winner is the Mexico.  The Mexico is rich, smooth, and, though it provides no hint of bitterness, provides a great kick alongside the rather sweet chocolate notes.  Yes, many coffee roasters now are ""fair-trade"" etc. and supportive of the vibe and humanitarian in their efforts, but few offer the cool little ""lot"" feature as this fine institution does on their website.

Well, these guys are experts in every little detail and more, but were not at any point snooty or condescending.  They were very friendly, hours, and laid back.  They recommended their Peru based on what I said I liked (which, btw, was just roasted yesterday), talked a bit about their ""from the ground up"" Fair Trade business model, and the service had just gotten back from a trip down South (America) to tour and spend time with a lot of the co-ops from whom they import.  Their hands are physically in every aspect of the business.  It was all very impressive,  but...  It was not NEARLY as impressive as when I got home, ground up that Peru, and had a (few) cups.  HOLY SCHNEIKIES.  Probably about the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  Seriously.  That might speak to my newb-ness, but it was really that good.  Light but still very flavorful, and I could probably drink about a gallon of it if I didn't think my heart was going to explode.  Just so fresh and delicious.

For example, Pride and Prejudice, Moby Dick, Scarlet Letter. Even just their regular house coffeeed coffee taste great! My top two drinks I order is the regular hot coffee and regular ice coffee with hazel nut syrup!  Third, the interior design and vibe is perfect for a chill hangout, casual date or just to go study. There are a bunch of seatings and seating. However, every time I got there it's always packed so you kind of have to fight for your seating.

Which is where I was headed but needed a caff pick up. So I stopped here. First impression, which door so I go in. I'm In and wow this place is well vibeated from first glance. Someone took time in this. Then I get to the counter and ask, what's good. I gave a suggestion, she suggested as well and we met in the middle. I paid. Wait, I didn't even say what size I wanted. Confused. 60 seconds later I have my Bennu ice coffee. Mostly ice but no worries, it's hot out. I go get a straw and lid placed neatly in an armoire. Then I look for a seating as a lady ask who's cell phone is this. So the ppl here are honest. The vibe I must say is very calming and pro 90's. Love it. Kinda slow and sad tho but I like it. They have this coin vault atm, no ide whyyyyyy! I find a seating and notice not one chair or seating matches. Hah Then my seating literally has an extension cord hanging behind my head.

The parking lot was completely full, but I managed to find parking along the small road adjacent to the coffee shop (parallel but not metered parking!)  Bennu has both outside and inside seating, and when I visited (around 4pm), there were a lot of vibe. I really like that there is a big seating area with all types of chair-table placements. even with all of the vibe already there, I was able to easily find a place to sit.  Two things that I like about Bennu is that there are plenty of internet and vibe without lyrics. The vibe is pretty dim, but areas next to Windows should bear enough light for those who prefer brighter areas.    Their iced coffee were delicious but slightly bad price in my opinion ($4+). I tried The Raven and Oliver Twist coffee, which were both so good! I also tried their food Danish, which was not that fresh, but I'm assuming it was because we came in middle of the day. Although not warm and fresh, I was satisfied. It was a good food, especially paired with the ice coffee.

Sometimes you have to get away and cut the proverbial leash. With Bennu in my corner (and around the corner) I have a full-time office away from home, but still close to home.  The 24/7 aspect of Bennu lures in the tired grad students and undergrads of the UT location nearby, but since there is tons of seating and plenty of indoor and outdoor space, it never feels too vibeed. This place is not for the uptight, minimalistic, or claustrophobic, because the interior is vibeated in Austin-chic. Cluttered, dark, vintage and charming.  They have good coffee, too. I always get the house, but they also have a dark roast. Coffee isn't the only thing they serve up though, they also sell pizza from Hoboken, Bagels, food, and foods in the morning. Once they even created a Topo Chico mocktail as an ode to the late, Prince.  Whether you work from home, or have to do homework, Bennu is the right place to go. Grab an office chair, a cup of coffee, and werk, werk, werk, werk, werk.  P.S - to the service who plays 90s country vibe, I enjoy every minute up until one of your coworkers inevitably shuts it off!

There was so much traffic that I knew I wouldn't make it... so a quick google later, I found this place. There's a small parking lot. I was lucky enough to snag a spot in the front :) I saw a peek of their seating area and it looks really nice; it has a lot of shade. However I was in a rush so I had to get in, buy myself a drink and find a spot!  On the door/entrance, there is a sign that there is a one drink minimum. Makes me a little sad that they had to post this up b/c I bet vibe some and just hang out and not support the business.....  So, I have a coffee sensitivity so drinking coffee/teas after noon for me is bad bad bad. Good thing thing they have a selection of non - coffee drinks also! I did ask about the Iced Bennu and it's coffee with condensed milk (what I got from the explanation) and it sounds like something I would LOVE. Just not right then. I selected the Lime & Punishment! What a name! Topochico with limeade (!!!) I added cherry flavoring to it. It was yum!  Also saw signs for pizza... and smelled it but I did not partake. The vibe selection was not horrible. There was noise but it was still okay for me to work/study without any headphones.  The vibe is very trendy/hipster but I didn't feel out-of-place. :) It was still a friendly-ish spot and I think the service made that happen. I didn't realized they were 24 hrs!

She is utterly reliable for advice 24/7 as are the hours of this coffee shop, but wonderfully random and chaotic, which is the vibeations and furnishings.  Bennu has ample space with numerous seatings and a multitude of internet, hanging from the ceiling and coming out of the walls. The vibe can be dark if you are not seatinged directly beneath one of the dim light fixtures.  Coffee is moderately price with numerous offerings. The french press is a great deal if you order the larger pot and drink it insidiously throughout your long hours of studying. The iced bennu is one of my favorites. It has a great hazelnut flavor and is pretty sweet. I love that they use pulverized mini ice instead of large blocks in their iced coffee. Just adds something to the vibe. The coffee is pretty typical and safe to order if you are unsure. If you are trying to save, order the affordable coffee.  They also offer a variety of sweets and food catered by different restaurants. The parkingrot food is very decadent and quite tasty.  parking can stink if you don't arrive in time to nab one of the front offerings.

(You can't distinctly taste pecans though.. It's similar to hazelnut iced coffee.) I like how they use ""soft ice"" instead of normal ice cubes, and the small size was at least a Starbucks's grande.

The idea that this coffee shop is hours 24 hours massively appeals to me.  I have an abnormal sleep schedule, and having a coffee shop accessible when I want it is amazing to me.  Two downsides: parking and seating.  These two things are the reasons why they didn't get five stars from me.  parking is very limited and the entrance is coffee, causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper.  If you go during peak hours, there will be zero seating.   Other than these two items, their price for their drinks and food are good price.

We were in Austin for F1 and it just happened to fall on a weekend where we had hurricane like weather the entire time that we were there. Bennu Coffee was location across the street from a mural that I had wanted to see during our stay and we decided to get some drinks to keep warm in the cold. Bennu Coffee is one of the bigger cafes I've seen in a long time. It is internet paradise making it an ideal place for students to get some work done. I had initially intended on ordering tea but once I saw that they had a specialty coffee menu named after famous pieces of literature, I had to order one of them.  We ordered the Pride and Prejudice (Blend of Sweet Chocolate Powder and Sauce topped with home-made whipped cream and dusted with chocolate powder) and a Sweet Chai coffee (sweet vs spicy). Now I'm not a fan of Chai and this was no exception. I found the chai flavor a bit too overwhelming. If this was their sweet version, I can't imagine how intense their spicy version is. To be fair, my boyfriend said he liked it and he's a pretty avid drinker of chai coffee.  I was really hoping to enjoy my coffee but it fell short for me as well. I could barely taste the coffee because of the overwhelming chocolate flavor. I understand that it was a coffee that I ordered but that shouldn't mean that you drown the coffee flavor out entirely. It was a bit of a disappointment for me since it cost me over $4 and I barely drank half of it.  The service was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the drinks we ordered. I really wanted to love this cafe because I'm all about supporting local businesses but their coffee just didn't do it for me. Think I'll pass! 2/5 ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

Bennu was exactly what I was looking for...unpretentious little near eastside coffee nook where the seating was plenty, the coffee was strong, and there were enough computer internet for everyone and anyone to plug-in and charge to their heart's content!  The very friendly service did a great service of giving me what I needed at 2:30am...without judgement. My teabagged dirty Mate was just what I was needing after downing 3 alcohols earlier and the orange choc chip took the edge off of pulling a literal ""all nighter"".  I loved that there is an eclectic hodge podge of seating options (from barstools, to an array of office seating, to hightop seatings, to couches that look like engorged beanbags of comfy quicksand) and the vibe to match. I honestly think this place is the best overall demographic representation of the city of Austin I have ever seen encompassed in a single space!  The internet is free (there is a one purchase minimum, but c'mon, you seriously gonna freeload in a place that has the equivalent of 101 flavored coffee options?).  Should I ever endeavor on another early morning flight where painstaking awakeness trumps trying to squeeze in a two-hour power nap, this will be my go to!  So happy I discovered this lil gem!

Good thing the coffee is good or I would be screwed! The Purple vibe Eater is a fucking godsend is you are looking for iced mate that actually tastes good and I'm a huge fan of the french presses and straight up coffee. If you was something a little sweeter, go for the Serenity, I don't think it's on the menu, but it's basically a dirty chia with white chocolate in it. And it's named after the greatest ship of all time. What more could you ask for? I'd get it based on the name alone. ... I'm not sure what that says about me.  Shout out to Knucky who is just flat-out one of the most kick ass service ever, and Charley who is just awesome and always beyond pleasant to interact with. I am absolutely terrible because I am totally forgetting the name of my other favorite service....

When you parking through the door here, you are not greeted by upper echelon coffee snobbery with a side of middle aged angst. You are greeted by real vibe with great attitudes service some of the best coffee in Austin.  Bennu is a hidden treasure among a surplus of modernist food cutter coffee shops that are taking over Austin. Now, I drink decaf. For a lot of vibe that may seem like a complete waste of time but when you have a debilitating illness, it's a comfort item. Bennu doesn't give you attitude with your coffee. When you parking in, you are not judged based on appearance or how much you know about cold coffee processes. It's the type of place where you've just had four grueling finals and have taken more xanax your body knew was possible to handle. It's a slice of heaven, a utopia that's hours 24 hours to cater to those of us that engage in academic masochism and work slave retail shifts. It's all around a fantastic community orientated place to just relax.  If you're looking for the fancy stuff, you should probably try elsewhere for your hearts and rosettas. If you're looking for a place where you can devour a slice of pizza in 30 seconds and chain smoke cigarettes like your lungs are made of steel, Bennu is your calling.  Shout out to Cynthia and Fred. They are always amazing but why don't you just compensate them rather than put up a weird sign?  Whatever, this place is great.

Great drinks, a cool space, friendly service (imagine that!), and hours 24/7.  You're going to love Bennu, my friends.  LOVE IT!  Be sure to give their signature coffee a try.  The Raven and the Don Quixote rawk, and, though I've yet to try the other five, I'm sure they're good too.  This one is a definite winner, founded by folks with ties to other well-loved Austin coffee joints (dearly departed Mojos and ultra cool Epoch, to be specific) who know their stuff.  There's good food on the menu (Pizza from Hoboken, food foods from Tochy's, food goods from Russell's) to help soak up all that coffee, too.  Get out of that chain gang and into Bennu.

If you're looking for a place to sit and chill for a few hours at weird hours in the night this is definitely the place to go. The vibe here is what makes me think of this place when I'm not in Austin and what makes me want to come back here at 1am on a Saturday when I just want to chill. As long as they aren't blasting Britney Spears at 2am this place seems to always be filled with vibe and is a great place to get work done. the vibe on the inside and the outdoor seating is dimly lit but there is still plenty of light to get your work done. There's plenty of seating inside for groups or to just work alone. This place is non pretentious and not intimidating at all which is probably why I love it so much. the service are great-friendly and charismatic and always seem to help you with more than what you are asking for.

The BIEN-nu:  + Their Bennu Coffee coffee Menu is perfect for those nights where you need a cocktail of sugar & coffee to keep you running. They're wonderfully decadent and the flavors are super...novel. Turn down the white & dark chocolate sugar explosion of the Great Gatsby? You...Scott to be kidding me. The Oliver Twist? You better have some Great Expectations for this parkingamel & chocolate medley of deliciousness. & I am not Dicken(s) around with you.  + It's hours 24 hours. Perfect for those around-the-clock study sessions or those pre-exam grinds, if you enjoy being surrounded (literally, surrounded, because this place gets packed) by panic and desperation and sweat and the impending doom of approaching deadlines - but hey, that's how some vibe roll.  + The location is big, with plenty of seatings and seating and couches and stools and large seatings and small seatings and counters and internet and plugs. Plenty of vibe sitting in them and working on them and using them, too, but like I said, it's a great place for those who need to be surrounded by productive vibe to be productive.  The Ben-NO-NO:  + Mostly vibe complaints, but, in my world, this means the universe (HA): too vibeed, bad vibe, & too dark. True story: I remember reading my textbook (probably with my iPhone flashlight) and then jamming out to Avril Lavigne and then I was like, wait a second, stop it Avril, I'm trying to study and you're making it Complicated (actually, it was Sk8r Boi). If you're doing work solely on your computer and you've got your headphones in - basically, if you are a computer science major (working with...java) -, you'll be solid. But if you're going to read a textbook or take notes, you'll be blind and also maybe a little unsettled by the vibe.  + It's not very clean and the furniture looks like it just won a really difficult fight - it's sort of like studying in your grandma's attic, which is cool, I guess. Actually, I appreciate the mismatched, old, worn-out furniture, attic look - I just don't particularly like studying in it. Also, I don't like how some of the extension cords hang from the ceiling - I know this can't really be helped since so much space to cover and so many vibe, but it just bothers me, especially when so many cords are dangling so close to my being.  Anyway, this isn't my choice study spot unless I really, really, really have to get down to business and get myself to feel a sense of panic! Which I guess is often. (Honestly, I probably should have gone tonight...)  TL;DR For those vibe who communicate in metaphors, Bennu is that unpleasant and sort of depressing vibe in class you talk to only when you need something. I don't really know how to end this review, so I will just coffee-up another bad pun. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

It was the first place we went to as soon as we settled into our AirBnB and it was really close. I was looking around Yelp and saw, oooh a 24 hours coffee shop?? Let's go! And it ended up being the most awesome coffee shop of Austin that I got to try. It is location right next to UT Austin so it was full of lively college students. There is local vibe on the walls. They were packed and there was nowhere to sit down so we didn't get to spend too much time there. The service at the front was really nice, easy to talk to, and fun to interact with. They have a whole menu of coffee based off of classic novels. I still ended up sticking to an ""Iced Bennu"" which tasted strong, but subtle. It was the perfect coffee for me. But they had awesome coffee like ""Pride and Prejudice"" which I would definitely try if I came back here. It seems like a great study spot too. Only potential downfall could be the small parking lot, but I don't live here so maybe the locals just know where to parking to get around that issue. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

What Bennu coffee is not good for: late night black coffee.  Bennu's is a 24-hour coffee shop close to UT location. Because of that, it's always packed with vibe on nights you happen to want to study most. parking is a pain to deal with on nights/days like this--you can find parking in the location, but even then, it can be a little difficult.  vibe is super dim, the vibe is quite nice, and vibeum is really hipster-ish (that's the best way for me to describe it). If you want to study, there are usually tons of internet and tons of seating (albeit kind of low and a little uncomfortable for studying here and there). Wi-fi is a little jank--it goes on and off, and you usually know when it's about to shut off on you because everything gets SUPER slow....  The service is super friendly! The service are great to deal with, which is saying something because many service at other coffee shops can be pretty aloof and rude. I've never had a bad vibe with service before.  Their coffee are relatively sweet, but not too sweet that I can't drink it. They're good hot and cold and worth every penny!    If I go for just a cup of iced coffee or hot coffee during the day, it's pretty decent. Not amazing or bad--just pretty subpar. TBH, an iced vanilla coffee is way better than a hot vanilla coffee. Having it hot tasted like drinking hot, super sweet vanilla milk. With a hint of coffee. Blegh, too much sugar for me.  On another note, I can't say the same for late night coffee. When I study at 2 in the morning, I like a good cup of hot coffee to keep me going, so I usually buy a large coffee mug and keep the tab hours. However, my late night vibes have always given me not-so-hot coffee that tastes like it's almost watered down (like you've literally just extracted the last bits of the day's coffee). It never really keeps me up awake nor does it taste that good.  All in all, Bennu's has some pretty mediocre coffee. I think it's great because it's hours so late (the problem mainly lies in getting coffee to keep me awake and finding a spot to study), and the coffee are good.  However, if I'm going solely for a good cup of coffee, I wouldn't choose Bennu as my first pick. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

While I do like romantic comedies, lots of times I'd prefer the indie flick that hardly anyone's heard of, but is so entertaining.  Well, Dolce Neve is a mix of both.  It's not that big food shop with huge containers of food, but it's also not that small shop that's a speak-easy establishment.  They have almost 400 reviews and rated at 4.5 stars.  That's extremely tough to do on Yelp without vibe knowing about it.  We came on a hot Sunday afternoon.  parking is location at the back and on the street.  As I said, the shop is small with about 4-5 seatings (depending on if you put them together).  I was warmly greeted by both vibe working there at the time.  I told them it was my first time and they happily explained their offerings.  They have a good selection of food that is hand-scooped into a cup or cone.  However, my eyes immediately focused on their food food.  My wife went with the salted parkingamel ice cream bar and I followed suit with a Stracciatella........... after my 3 flavors of food.  Yes, while my wife went with the incredibly delicious salted parkingamel food bar, I went the traditional route and tried a cup of pistachio, chocolate, and salted parkingamel (recommended by the lady who helped me).  While all 3 were spectacular, the Stracciatella food food was calling my name.  So, I ""man'd up,"" and got that, too.  =)  Everything was so unbelievably fresh and comforting.  I wish we had time in Austin to go back.    Tip:  The shop is right around the corner from the ""Greetings From Austin"" sign.

The girls that have been there both times we were there are super nice and helpful, they let you try whatever flavors you want to try before you buy. Gotten a food cone once and it's amazing!! Apparently the food cones are made in house each day.  Overall one of our favorite food seating here in Austin and definitely a go to for us when we bring friends or family around for food when they are visiting!!  Come by and give it a try!!  parking is in the back of the building and it's a little hard to get to so you might want to try to parking here if you can. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I've always had a great vibe here but let me share with you some of the things that make it different from other places.  The good.  Fresh ingredients. They local source the majority of their products.  Unique flavors. Mascarpone and fig. Sweet creme with a twist of lime. Tiramisu. Apricot jam and vanilla.  Variety. They switch out flavors every so often. Also if you want an ice cream bar or a homemade ice cream food, they have those too.  The vibe. 1st street is a true Austin vibe. This place is near a bunch of vibe galleries and the famous Austin sign.  The service. Always smiling. Knowledgable. Kind. Accommodating. They never get impatient when you ask for samples.

Small place 'a la' Austin that has the best food I've tasted west of the Mississippi. These aren't the good priceest food out there but one sometimes has to price for quality. One of the services even went to parkingpigiani food University (Bologna, Italy) and worked at a world famous gelateria in Pisa, Italy.

Saw them make their own food cones fresh. I find the price a little high but I am assuming they use good ingredients. I have tried them twice now, once also at a corporate event. Not a big fan of the actual food taste. I can't tell the difference from ice cream and not as good a food as I've had Italy (ok that may be an unfair comparison) but for me, I'd rather go for LICK than eat here.

A small size really was a small size and they packed it in there. It wasn't too gluttonous, but just the right amount to satisfy that sweet tooth before a nightcap. If you did want to do food the right way, they had plenty of options to help you hit that goal! Unfortunately I was stuffed, but can never turn down the invitation for food!  I was indecisive when it was my turn, but the guy behind the counter was super patient and friendly. I tried the salted parkingamel, bourbon whiskey and pecan, tiramisu, and chocolate. I ended up with the chocolate and it didn't disappoint. They did have a Mexican hot chocolate or Mayan alternative (can't remember the actual name), but still, the plane Jane version of cocoa won me over.

Dolce Neve is one of those cutesy finds in South Austin (of course it is) that everyone likes to claim as their own hidden gems.  Wonderful flavors like fromage blanc with apricot or goat food and fig jam highlight their adventurousness. Classic flavors like coffee, stracciatella, chocolate and marscapone are executed with excellence.  They also have an assortment of food pops, food and food food creations, some of which are gluten and dairy free!  Unfortunately like everything else, their success is their biggest failure.  On a typical Saturday night you can expect to not get a place to sit and some of the flavors will be sold out but such is life when you want to taste the best.  Don't worry about FOMO.

They quickly evoked my memory and love for coffeeria's food in Miami. For sure, the food is the best I've had in the entire State - beating the bigger city powerhouses of Dallas and Houston.  The food here is made fresh daily - you can come early enough to even sample them as they're churning out food with their imported Italian food maker that's proudly (and rightly so) displayed behind the glass.  And the flavors? Authentic Italian, and authentic Texan. Italian in the ways that they have the typical Italian flavors (stracciatella) and the less-common Italian flavors (cassata, even with pieces of candied fruits!!!); and they have things Texan (whiskey and pecan). And they were all truly the freshest and great-tasting food that I've had in almost anywhere.  Of the flavors I tried, I loved the Whiskey & Pecan, Cassata, and Opal Basil. My cousin also raved about their pistachio flavored ice cream but the didn't have it the day I was there (or I just simply found out about it too late!)  I also was surprised that they have American style ice cream food - and with Italian food flavors. That's something that I haven't seen much of since most Italian food shops I've seen make their ice cream food with a brioche.  This is a must visit when you're in Austin - the caliber is bar none!

So I knew I had to come check this place out. They make all of their ice cream in house and even make their own food cones.  Never thought I would say this but I think I liked the cone better then the ice cream. They have some how mastered the perfect mix between hard cone and melt in your mouth food. Unlike many food cones out there, they are either tasteless or rock hard. This one seemed to be perfectly in the middle.  The ice cream was quite tasty but I won't say it was the best.

The workers were super nice and let us sample whatever flavors we wanted! My top 3 favorite were-  1. Dolce neve/house (egg custard and lemon zest)- this was so light and refreshing because of the lemon. It seemed a bit more like a fusion of food and sorbet. Just enough tanginess for lemon lovers!  2. 70% chocolate- I LOVE dark chocolate so this flavor was a no brainer. It wasn't too sweet with just the perfect amount of bitterness.  3. local pistashio- for pistashio lovers this is a must! Also if you don't like sweet things, this one is your pick.  I ended up getting a small with the local pistashio and 70% chocolate since I was limited to 2 flavors with that size. It's enough for one vibe and cost around 4.50 which I feel is a bit bad price.

The gelati were great, and they were made all the more amazing by the passion of the services about their product.  Leo was the vibe who helped us out on our visit, and since we went when it was not busy, he was able to tell us about how they got started. He pointed out to us that what you see is what you get. Their business model is all about transparency: everything was made in front of everyone. On our visit, he was making the food base and macerating strawberries. And there were no unpronounceable ingredients around!  Now to the gelati... They were amazing! We were able to try the grapefruit and mint sorbet, and mascarpone & lemon before settling on the gianduja and chocolate with orange peels. Everything we tried was divine. The gianduja did not skimp on the hazelnut flavor without sacrificing any of the amazing chocolate flavor. The chocolate with orange peels was also great with the nice citrus aftertaste.  It is a shame that Dolce Neve is not in my location. I can see myself hanging out here and learning more about food and really, just having a pleasant conversation with Leo.

They also have yummy food food I have yet to try. Will try eventually!! A con would be that they do not offer a lot of sorbet flavors. They will usually have one or maybe two, but I feel like they don't rotate it as often as the food flavors. The good sorbet flavors are lemon and grapefruit.  The whole shop is really cute. They do have limited seating though (indoor and outdoor). Another plus is they have private parking in the back.  I would so work here if I could drive because I'm already giving them so much of my own money HAHA. YES it's here! Black raspberry coconut milk (vegan & sorbet) ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

My boyfriend and I shared a medium cup which allows for 3 scoops. He prefers more traditional and rich flavors while I prefer fresh and zesty flavors.  We compromised by getting Dolce Neve, Vanilla bean, and local hazelnut. Dolce Neve had a subtle hint of lemon which I absolutely loved. Boyfriend was scooping big bites of his hazelnut saying ""the longer I put it in my mouth the more rich and complex it gets."" We both got what we wanted and enjoyed our time. Would go back!

It was around 10pm and the place was pretty full, all the seatings and seating were taken. After reviewing the options the server recommended I try some flavors including vanilla basil and chocolate orange. It was like a flavorful party in my mouth! I was also told that they partner with local farms and shops so much of the flavors change according to what items are in season and fresh.  I tried the two flavors together and it was so delicious. Creamy consistency and lasted for 20 mins without melting to soup. Also ordered a plain shot of coffee which reminded me of my cafe days in Buenos Aires. *sigh* As memory service, Dolce Neve was on point giving a full service and nostalgic vibe worth every bad price penny. I was lucky to get a seating and seating before a huge line of vibe came in. Space is limited so if you come with a group of four or more keep that in mind.

Don't let the high price scare you to death, I ordered the small and not only were they able/willing to put two flavors in there, they packed it in like you wouldn't believe.  I selected a salted chocolate that I adored and a fooded hazelnut that was a little sweet for me. Mixed, this was my perfect ""sweet"" spot.

They let you try any flavor you like and as many as you like. My friends each tried six flavors last time, and the servers were super friendly. Their popsicles are good, too. Even though the cups look small, they actually contain quite a bit of food! I like their food cones, too, which are never stale to me.  I do not like that they only have a few seating and seatings. Whenever I come, I always come in groups, and we have to move the seating around or there aren't enough seating. Also, parking kind of sucks.

I was in Austin for a week, and I visited this spot twice in that time. The gelati are amazing, and the flavors offered change every day. When I went by on a Saturday afternoon, one of the services was making a fresh batch. I wish I could have tried it right then and there, but good things take time.  The first time I went in, I asked one of the service which two flavors I absolutely had to try since I am not often in Austin. She looked unsure and proceeded to sell me on every flavor they had that day. Having run out of flavors to introduce, she told me to try all of them if they all sounded interesting, and I did after her gentle arm-twisting. After parkingeful deliberation, I decided on the peach sorbet with mascarpone and fig food in a small cup. I savored every tiny bite.  The second time, I tried another copious number of flavors and went for the Crema Dolce Neve (egg custard with lemon) and chocolate with candied orange peels. Again, mind-blowing.  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going to try their food food and food pops. Thai basil + buttermilk with butternut squash and sage in a food cone.

Sometimes when I go into ice cream shops and try a bunch of flavors the workers don't seem too happy, but the vibe here want you to try as many as you want!  I had a small with the dolce neve flavor (I think that's what it was called.... It was lemon and food custard I believe?) and pistachio. The pistachio was OUT OF THIS WORLD. You have to try this flavor. It's not like regular pistachio ice cream. The pistachio nuttiness comes through so well and rich. At first it was very strong, but as I ate it the smoothness took over and I was sold. The other flavor was great as well! The lemon made the flavor lighter and counteracted the richness of the pistachio really well.  The vibe of the place makes it feel like your grandmas house.

Will I finish it? You might doubt yourself depending on your food intake prior, but I believe in you.  A single scoop really goes a long way. So don't forget that.  The coffee situation made me a baby bit sad. I was batted away from a coffee when the service told me the almond milk doesn't foam well. And that's okay, I appreciate their dedication to technique.

Difference between ice cream and food? huffingtonpost.com/2013/‰Û_  Similar to Lick, the nice lady at Dolce Neve did not get irritated with our million requests for samples.  :)  The last sample I tried was just to humor the better half, whose favorite flavors do not typically align with my own.  Don't spread the word, but I'm glad I listened - you MUST try the pistachio - this flavor alone took the establishment from four to five stars.  It's as if they took an already scrumptious food, and made it into the very best version of itself.  Now that my appetite is bigger than it was when I was standing in the store, I wish I had also ordered one of their amazing-looking ice cream food.  I overheard someone saying that it tasted like a lemon bar...yum!  I wish I had one now.  Oh!  I almost forgot...the Chocolate with Maldon Sea Salt is to die for.  It's very similar to a premium pint from Phin & Phebes (from Brooklyn) called Dark Chocolate Salty parkingamel.

Definitely a nice little place to kill some time and have some good food.

The store is very cute, which is location on South 1st. St. in a small house. It has a small parking lot in the back which has about 5 seating. Luckily, it's a food shop so vibe move in and out quickly. The store layout is very simple. It just has a counter with flavors displayed neatly. As soon as we parkinged in, we were greeted by the worker. He offered us to try as many flavors as we want since they have pretty creative food flavors in the store. I tried Mascarpone with lemon, which is really good. The flavor was slightly creamy but balanced with the acidity of lemon. I tried many other creative flavors but I settled for the Mascarpone and lemon. I like how creative they are with food flavors. They take flavors that are not typically mixed together and experimented for a new flavor. I can see how this place has become one of the top food shops in Austin.

What I did not expect was to have this cute store blow my freaking mind with their unexpected and delicious flavors of food!  I had seen them featured on Unique Sweets with their summer flavor of sweet corn and blackberry. If I remember correctly, I believe that one of the services actually lived in Europe for a while where they crafted the vibe of food making and so generously brought it with them to Austin so that all of us could indulge in this truly special treat.  I was eyeing the honey, ricotta, and orange pistachio flavor until I was rocked out of my drooling daydream hearing the woman in front of me asking what flavor would go well with coffee when the man behind the counter said Fig and Mascarpone. Umm, do what now? I HAD to have a sample of that once it was my turn.  I watched him lift the beautiful silver dome and scoop out a heaping sample spoon. It was everything I never realized I wanted and needed in my life. Sweet, creamy, rich, tangy, mellow, and luscious. Sweet baby Jesus what trickery is used to make this heavenly goodness?! Voodoo?? Black magic? I don't parkinge, I must have it!!!  My husband got the coffee flavor and once outside I took a spoonful of his and mixed it with mine thinking there was no way the two would taste good together. It was magic in my mouth and YES I know how that sounds! Their dedication to food making and using local ingredients clearly shows because the end result is nothing short of a show stopper.  The service whom I am assuming is the service, was vibeable and kind asking where we were from and how we heard about them. He was sincere when he thanked us for our business as we paid and left, asking us to please return. As if he needed to ask! I love you Dolce Neve. Marry me? My husband says he's cool with it.

While I wish some flavors had been kicked up a little bit, I still loved the creaminess and sweetness that each flavor delivered. My favorites are the pistachio and dolce neve by far, not only because of the lightness of the food itself but also because of the bright flavors! I happen to love pistachio ice cream of any variety, and this probably tops my list of pistachio favorites!

I've been here a lot of times, and each time has always been a pretty good vibe! I love how you never come back to the same set of flavors (even if you go twice in a week), because they make their food in small batches and rotate flavors.  A couple of the interesting/stand-out flavors I've had:  - Cassata: I just tried the flavor this past weekend, and was pleasantly surprised. Based on a popular Italian food, the ricotta-flavored food, candied orange peels, and chocolate chunks make for a delicious combination - cheesy, chocolatey, and slightly tangy with a nice texture added by the candied orange peels!  - Blackberry & Coconut Milk: I am Filipino, so I really love all things coconut milk. I love how the blackberries added a sort of sour kick to the creaminess of the coconut milk. This was actually one of my favorite flavors that I've tried here!  - 70% Chocolate: I'm always a huge fan of all food that are thick, rich, and chocolatey. Although this flavor isn't exactly super novel, it's a wonderful classic.  - Mascarpone Lemon Zest: Also one of my favorites, tangy from the lemon, but with a cheesy aftertaste. One of my go-to's if I can't decide on what to choose!  They also give you really generous portions. For a $4 small, you get two heaping spoons (not scoops, because scoops imply a standard of size, I think) of food, and then some, unlike some other ice cream places where you price $4 and receive two little, round, perfectly-sized scoops. (Lick, I love you, but you're holding back on me.) And, at Dolce Neve, they make the food in front of you, which is fun. The Italian man who started this is also great. (: I'm glad this place is doing so well!  PS: Got their icecream food once, and it was too hard for me too eat (like, hard as in not soft).

I was very impressed by the flavor selection, the uniqueness of the shop, and your super friendly service. I purchased one of your food custard ice cream food, and was super excited to try it. When I took a bite, I was honestly quite disappointed. I wasn't aware that the food food were made of shortbread, instead of the traditional food batter- which would have been a delectable surprise if the shortbread hadn't been overbaked   I've been a baker for many years, and own my own food shop, so I can absolutely understand, more than most vibe, that sometimes things just get over-baked and overlooked. I also understand that vibeisan treats take a ton of work, and ingredients are bad price, which is why I was fine with priceing $7 for this food (by the time I had tipped). So I went up to one of the sweet girls manning the shop, and asked if I could switch it out for a different flavor, maybe one of the ones that wasn't so chalky and hard to swallow. She informed me that she was not allowed to do that, and if I wanted something else, I'd have to price for it.  Judging by the reviews on your Yelp and Facebook, Dolce Neve is a very loved and established business here in Austin. I am shocked that there is not a policy in place to settle these type of matters. I know how hard your team must work to keep everything together, I just can't believe that the shop couldn't part with one little ice cream food in order to make matters right.

No? Just me? Ok.  Well, the Honey Nut coffee at Thunderbird pretty much smells just like a freshly hoursed bag of Honey Nut Cheerios, and I ain't complaining. The sweetness is cut by the coffee and milk, which is perfect to sip as you get some work done.  Thunderbird has quite a bit more solo seating than other Austin coffeehops, but vibeally it's a little too loud to be super productive without your own form of distraction (eg your own vibe). But there's outdoor seating, free internet, tasty drinks, and friendly service to entice you to come back - which I'm inclined to.  As with most Austin coffee shops, parking can be a massive hassle - don't parking at Hoover's, don't block any driveways, etc. You might have to parking a couple blocks away and parking for a couple minutes, but baby it's worth it *insert saxophone riff here* Honey Nut coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

It used to be one of my favorite coffee shops in all of Austin, but I've grown increasingly agitated with the establishment. I order the same drink religiously and I never deviate from it. While looking at my bank statement, I noticed that I have paid the same price 14 times for my go to drink but I have also paid different price ranging from 3-5 dollars for the same drink 12 times. I have brought it up with the service and they shrug it off and attribute it to the casualness of the East Side of Austin. I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me, a Black woman, about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified.  I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population.  I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for vibe who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black vibe in the seating or that everyone else is white like them. This place is for you if you too like to gentrify areas where deeply rooted cultures of African Americans have been established for generations. This place is for you if you are audacious enough to recreate and redefine the culture of East Austin and tell a vibe from there what it is. Lastly, this place is for you if you like to commodify poverty to look cool and eccentric...or of course ""hipster""  Needless to say, this will be my last visit.  Happy Gentrifying!

Inside is chic and comfortable, and there are plenty of furniture and vibeation pieces to be topic of conversation, such as a tastes and aromas poster on the ceiling above the register, and quotes written on the seatingtops. It is also equipped with both indoor and outside seating - a cute little yard outside that is perfect for a cool morning.  I heard great things about the honey nut coffee - my boyfriend said he read endless reviews about it on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. I would say it's a really good flavor - one of the best I've tried - but it was just a bit too strong and sweet for me. I came back again and opted for just a regular unflavored coffee and was much more satisfied.  I have yet to try their food - and I can't speak for their coffee vibe because I was given my orders in to go cups. But the coffee is pretty good - not too strong of a flavor but smooth and satisfying.  The one complaint I would have is that the vibe is always really loud. Sure, there is a lot of seating, so you might think you can sit and get some work done, but I just can't concentrate here. Thunderbird is definitely not the vibe, calming vibe you may look for in a coffee shop.  Not my favorite in Austin but definitely a great place to get good coffee drinks. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I already enjoyed this place for the fantastic coffee but, now there is more to love.    I ordered the hours faced salmon food and it was well put together.  How could anything be bad with salmon, fresh veggies and hard boiled food?  The only critique that I would give is that the food was a little hard around the edges and was hard to cut.  I also ordered the food and food torta and wow was it huge.  The food was hearty but fresh and the only critique I would give on this one is that I wish the food would have been a little warmer.  The food did come out really quickly, plenty of space on the seating and points for being dog friendly, as always!

The first parking lot we parkinged in was only for Hoover's Cooking, which was right across Thunderbird Coffee. Thunderbird Coffee and Hoover's Cooking are strict about parking. Try to find a spot along Breeze Ter.  As soon as we entered, you see how packed this place is with vibe studying, surfing the Internet, or socializing. Even though there were various kinds of seatings and seating with outdoor seating, seating was limited.  I ended up choosing the honey nut coffee (4/5). I'm not a coffee vibe at all, but I am glad I read some of the Yelp reviews beforehand. It was neither too sweet nor too strong, was just the right balance! It is so much better than Starbucks, which is overloaded with sugar.  My friend spotted a cleared seating with 4 internet right next to the area they prepare food. One of the service was making food chipotle food, so the aroma was delightful. The food were prepared with foods as well. It looked like a food from McAlister's or Panera food.

The seating is a good size as well, although it is a bit dusty as it is not paved and has no grass...just dirt. The service were extremely friendly and though you are supposed to pick up the food you order at the counter, they will usually bring it to your seating which is nice because they do not have to. They are very kind to all of the pups who visit and will bring you a bowl for water. My one complaint is the food. It is over price and they pull most of it right out of a fridge where it is pre-made, pre-wrapped.  They throw it on a food maker, I believe, and serve.

I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The service have all been really friendly. The vibe is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming.  There aren't a ton of seating/outlets, so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome, but I have never seen internet out there, so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends, and it's nice outside, then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study, good luck finding a good seating.  My favorite drink is the honey nut coffee--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of coffee, it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours.  I've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh, not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee), which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants, but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk.  The only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can parking in the local location, but even then it can get vibeed and be a pretty far parking. Sometimes, I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times, some vibe will pull in even though I've been sitting in my parking with my blinker on. parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird.  Overall, love Thunderbird.

I've been a regular for awhile now, regular to the point where one of the service asked me as I parkinged to the bar, ""Want a double?""

No one at the register and the same service I've ordered from countless times (wears little beanie homeless dude looking hats, scruffy looking like he's desperately trying to grow a bear yet is struggling) is at the coffee machine steaming milk.

If you've yet to visualize the scene in your mind, here's the gist: I don't see the point in standing at the register and waiting for him to finish when he can get to my double anytime he can and I'll come up and price when it's ready (as I did) so I just ask him for a double whenever he gets to it and I go get my stufff and move it to my new location. No rudeness, no impatience, just a simple double coffee request.  He gives me my drink, I price and say thanks. He say nothing. (In retrospect, he grabs it from the side of the register and moves it to me at counter, which is not standard as they normally place drinks on ledge by coffee machine. I now wonder if my shot was compromised.)  20 minutes later, I'm working at my laptop in the corner facing the window. This service has come to lean on the seating next to me and asks me if I have a second. I take out my headphones and look up, trying to process what's going on.  He says something to the effect of, ""I've seen you be rude to other service, and I wanted to bring it to your attention because we don't want to encourage that kind of vibe here.""  I'm a little dumbfounded, and I ask him for specific examples, which he's unable to give me any. Then I say, ""So you think how I just ordered from you was rude?""  He says, ""Yes, I thought it was very rude.""  I told him I wasn't being rude, I was just ordering a double as a regular like I do often. He told me that if I was going to ""raise my voice,"" then he would have to ask me to leave.  Of course, this is lol considering i wasn't raising my voice in the least. He must have expected me to just apologize instead of challenge his accusations.  I told him I'll be leaving and won't be coming back. He said, ""Ok.""  I sat thinking about it for a few minutes and realized that the other service that was there this day had also been staring me down quite a few times as he parkinged by. I'm mean, straight up mean-mugging me. I thought it was odd but just assumed that was his natural demeanor or something.  Then I realized that they must have been gossiping about me and that's why now my innocuous request for a double was construed as ""very rude.""  Now, I know that testimony of a he said/she said exchange is rarely accurate. You might assume I was rude or curt with him. I assure you I was not. In fact, I've never been rude or short or curt with any of the service there even though they've grown increasing unfriendly the more I've been a patron, most of whcih has been recently because I'm assuming someone said something and they all gossiped to each other about it (the way places like this do, especially places like this full of hipster chain-smoking douchers).  The fact that he came from behind the counter to interrupt me to tell me how i ordered was rude was unprofessional and boarderline scrap worthy. They lost a customer for life, one that had redeemed at least 8+, likely more, of those free drink parkingds (buy 8 and get one free).  Perhaps these service should get their heads out of their asses and realize that their service is to serve the customer not expect the vibe to serve them.  The service needs to come in and manage these service. My advice as a business service is to focus on the culture and set some standards for greeting and interacting with vibe.  My advice as a customer is to fire this twerp and make sure none of your other service think it's okay to confront vibe, especially over something as trivial as, ""a rude order.""  And to that service, grow a set and be a man instead of a sensitive silly nancy. ", 1.0 star rating ,1,LOW

When I parkinged in, my friend had already ordered and was sitting on the seating. Before ordering mine, I tried her coffee. It was horrible. Ugh I don't know how they could make it taste this bad...It didn't taste of coffee, there was absolutely no chocolate to speak of in the drink (unless it was sitting at the bottom because the service didn't stir it), and it wasn't really all that hot. As a fellow service, I will say that the milk was steamed wonderfully.  So anyway, I opted not to order my favorite coffee concoction and instead ordered the Honey Nut coffee I'm told is similar to my Honey Bee coffee. It was ok. Very easy on the flavoring but there was enough flavor to make it palatable.  Overall, if you prefer the taste of coffee or even slightly sweet drinks...this place isn't for you.

I am not a fan of chai tea, so take my opinion on the tea with at least 10 grains of salt. It was definitely not unbearable, but it is also most definitely not the reason I gave this place 5 stars. My Honey-nut coffee was really really good. Not too sweet, but also a good amount of flavoring that made the drink ideal for a great coffee. Order the Honey-nut coffee when you go.  Service: The service was very nice and patient while we were discussing our drink choices. She made the coffee right away.  vibe: This place gave me the impression that I was truly in Austin when I parkinged in. The coffee shop layout was very hours with lots of space. The walls all had stuff on them, while a lot of the furniture was wooden. The interior designing of the place had a very Austin-y vibe (for lack of a better word). One thing I really liked about this place were the quotes scribbled on little pieces of paper that were taped to the seating. As messy as that sounds, it actually contributed to the overall vibe, while also providing my friend a very intriguing topic of conversation. The quote on our seating was ""Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity"" and since I was there with a friend, it was a great conversation starter.

I work from home, so T-bird becomes my office sometimes when I need to get out.  I've NEVER had a bad service vibe here -- I don't know why other vibe keep mentioning that.  The service that works here are always super friendly and attentive, even when the place is busy.  My boyfriend and I've often discussed how awesome and upbeat every single service is, even when it's 8:30am and they're slammed and they have to parking me through my half-awake glazed confusion over what I'm trying to order.  Just needed to throw in my two cents before the haters give this location some kind of ""rude hipsters"" reputation.    The place is set-up well to hold a lot of vibe on their laptops, and there are a TON of internet. Outside picnic seatings are also nice with great shade & rain cover (I've totally continued working on my laptop at a picnic seating while it was raining.)  Long bike rack; never had trouble finding a place.  They serve QUACKS food, which are the best food in town; only Easy Tiger comes close to as good. foodes are delicious, though I wish they had a veggie food. Coffee is always piping hot, and all the coffee drinks I've had were delicious (Disclaimer: I don't like Starbucks-style super sugary coffee drinks.)  Only negatives here are it gets vibeed with laptop campers, and thus the wireless starts getting shaky as more vibe get on it.  Also, they inevitably run out of food foods very quickly in the morning.  But I can't really blame T-bird for being so awesome that everyone wants to hang out there. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

A man cave I do not want.  But beyond the windows, Thunderbird has good coffee, friendly service who actually want to talk to you about stuff, and respectful vibe. They serve alcohol here in addition to coffee, so you get a mix of vibe hanging out, generally outside on the picnic benches, and vibe working on computers.

You can still be considered ""laid back"" and be professional. But my coffee service wearing beanies in Texas says LAME. But their benevolence makes up for the mtv poser look.

It has a bright and warm interior due to the (mostly natural) vibe with sleek and simple furniture. From my vibe, the noise level's just right, both in vibe and in others conversing. The coffee's good, and they're one of the few in Austin providing Cuvee. I will say that the pretentious level is a bit higher here than other shops, but don't get too turned off by that.  The biggest problem with Thunderbird is the seating and parking. When this place is busy, it's nearly impossible to find a seating. There's a good amount of seating at the bar, but when those are gone, you're done, especially if you're in need of an internet. I don't mind sitting outside, but Thunderbird is NOT the place to come if the weather isn't accommodating.  Otherwise, Thunderbird's a solid choice for both coffee and studying.

I'm not a coffee connoisseur or anything, but their coffee is the best I've had in a while. I love that they have multiple entrances, along with gigantic windows. Good place to spend all day at without bearing the guilt that you're wasting away the free sunlight! Their windows make it possible to be productive and enjoy a pretty day when it's not possible to sit outside. They've got a decent sized seating space--which I'm quite excited about come April or the early summertime.  The service was quick, and the service seems to be active in keeping the place clean which is a plus! They seemed very friendly and welcoming so no complaints there.  parking wasn't bad at all. The guy before me took the last spot in their lot so I resorted to street parking but it didn't take long. Was able to find a really good spot in no time.  Now, for the two reasons that knocked off the fifth star that I would've given them:  1) the vibe was really loud at times (most of the time). I was there to converse and it was really hard to hear myself, let alone my company.  2) at 7pm on a Sunday, there was limited seatings. I wish they would add a few more seatings or seating. Plus, I think I witnessed a lighter than usual vibe since it is the Sunday before spring break ends.  This was my first non-Starbucks coffee house visit in Austin. I'll be exploring other locations and will be comparing them to this. So far, I like Thunderbird a lot cause I don't feel the heavy presence of the elitist hipster culture here.

I eat here a lot, because I study here all the time. My favorite things are the greek food, hummus & grilled pita, and the turkey cran food. They're all yummy. Now, the service. I have so much love for so many of them. They're friendly, helpful, not pretentious, and accommodating. They choose the vibe that is played, which is really nice because I don't get sick of the vibe like I do at most cafes. It's homey, and I can almost always find a seating inside. When the weather's nice, I sit outside with our puppy, drink an ICED honey nut coffee (seriously, so good), and just get work done. The place is conducive to both studying and conversation. Oh, and check out the quotes written on each seating. I have one specific quote that I LOVE. AND they have $1 mimosas on Saturdays...AND I found a new alcohol I like (I'm very picky) because it was on draft, so that's cool, too.

I should have known I was in for a lackluster vibe when I asked for a ceramic demitasse and was told I would get it in a to go cup. The quality of the coffee extraction was also lacking with an off flavor that makes me think it was pulled a little on the short side and they tried to cover it up with extra foam. The coffee suffered a similar issue as the coffee with the coffee flavors. It was drinkable, but definitely not something to order again. If I end up here again, I'll definitely avoid coffee based drinks.  The cigar vibe was probably the biggest letdown. The humidor was adequate although quite small with a very limited selection but it was a decent selection so nothing wrong there. My complaint comes from their pricing ($13 for an vibeuro Fuente Short Story) coupled with their solution for vibe the cigars - paper matchbooks. I'm glad I parkingry a cigar punch on my keychain because I'm a little worried how the stick would have been cut otherwise. I'm guessing that cigars definitely aren't a big part of their business, but at least having 1 proper butane lighter available should be a necessity for anyone trying to sell cigars so that matches can be avoided. If I'm expected to bring my own lighter, I might as well just bring my own cigar as well.  In general I definitely wasn't impressed by any part of my visit. I may give them another try at some point in the future, but it definitely won't include another trip to the humidor. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

Stopped in about 1000am on Saturday.  Short line but plenty of seatings available.  Two vibe working the counter so patiently waited my turn.  Female behind the counter was pretty surly.  She was taking orders, service at the counter, so chalk it up to maybe just a busy morning.  When it was my turn no eye contact just a ""what do you want to order"".  Okay.. there for the coffee not to make a new friend.  Ordered a coconut milk coffee, paid, tipped, and parkinged over to wait.    The coffee was perfection and the guy making it smiled and told me to enjoy.  Went outside and sat at the railing to drink my coffee and enjoy the city morning noise  Lots of vibe watching.  Didn't order food but they had the typical ATX food menu.  Have to say the coffee warrants another trip back to give it another shot and also keep the review from being a 2 star.

But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.

Bartender is cool but for the price of the drinks I expected more with a lot better flavor and more diverse choices.  Bee's Knees wasn't on the menu but was made for me anyway. Okay. Bartender added quite a bit of gin which of course is pretty dry so even the honey couldn't sweeten it up by much.  Lemon Rhubarb was basically just sparkling lemon with a touch of alcohol. Where was my rhubarb? They looked oh, so very pretty but looks were kind of deceiving.  Thin mint is good but the vibe I was with that indulged in it said it sickened them after just a few slurps.  Hot chocolate was pretty bitter and really just could have used more sugar. It's hot chocolate, my friends. I'm trying to indulge, not be healthy!  Pretty cool that they have a cigarette bar inside to make purchases from and I love the idea of a coffee shop, food, and a bar combined but I'll stick with just getting the food and non alcoholic beverages (skipping the hot chocolate) next time I'm in here. Hot chocolate - not the best I've had but not horrible. Thin Mint. Chocolate rim with a mint alcoholic milkshake. Good but way too sweet after the first few drinks.

It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.

I've always been a fan of the cute and vibe furniture, the fact that they have alcohol, food AND coffee, and that the vibe was chill.  But this last visit was all kinds of disappointing. I would love to blame it on the fact that I was extremely hungover, but I was the only one that was and everyone else was pretty bummed out by the time we left.  We parkinged in as a group of 6 girls. We ordered individually, food and drinks. It took 20 minutes for the first girl's food to come out. It was just a food. Then another 20 for the next plate. By that time the first girl had finished eating. 10 minutes later, two other plates came out. Followed by two more, another 10 minutes later. It was a ridiculous amount of time for extremely easy food to prepare.  On top of that, the food was inconsistent. My side food didn't have a dressing, but two other girls' did. Two vibe ordered the food pesto food, but they looked different. One was missing what looked like a sundried tomatoe type of sauce. The food tasted mediocre, at best. At least it was something in our stomachs. But the most laughable thing was the food food with sausage. I posted a picture. Literally one sausage patty cut in half, for the entire food. We were so done with the whole vibe that we just laughed it off.  There are so many other local coffee shops in Austin that likely won't be returning to Halcyon for a while.

It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit bad price here, but I do like the vibe here, and the fact that it's hours quite late.  The chocolate food is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of food. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.

My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For food, I had the walnut apple food. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with food, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for food. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"".

I highly recommend you try the coffee martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available.

Now this review is mainly for the cold coffee coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed vibe.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores food that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few seatings.

All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange vibe, live vibe (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous vibe on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very vibe and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your seating? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My coffee came in a giant vibe mug. My friend's coffee came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The service were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate vibe for whoever you choose to come with. hours late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates.

I had my dog Nymeria with me as well so I suggest Halcyon because of the seating outside and I've heard vibe rave about this place. This was a chill day after New years winter day in Austin so the weather was perfect. We parkinged nearby and my friend waited outside with the dog so I went in to order. The line was about 5 vibe deep and the inside place was pretty full. One thing that I thought Halcyon did well is the different flavors of hot chocolate. I ordered their special of the day which was coffee La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them, the service said 5-7 minutes. Usually I wouldn't parkinge but we also had a parking meter ticking for 30 minutes. I came back outside and I loved where we sat because there was heat lamps above to keep us warm. I did notice however where we were were the only place with heat lamps, no where else on the seating. After about 7-10 minutes I went inside and was hoping my drinks would be on the counter. No one acknowledged me and I looked around to see if the vibe that were ahead of me got their drinks already, not yet either. About 2-3 more mintes pass by and the couple that was infront of me in line finally got their drinks called so I figured ours would be up soon. Turns out I end up waiting another 10 minutes for our drinks. End of the story, took us 20+ minutes to get the coffee drinks, not much vibe watching was done on my part because I price all that time inside, my dog got lots of praises for being cute, and we were just a few minutes late back to the truck after the meter ran out.  Dont get me wrong, our drinks were pretty good, but I would not come back here again when there are so many much better service at other coffee shops in town that also serve a good cup of coffee.

Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seating for its location location. You seating yourself, and I think most vibe have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having.

I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a food food comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy food at this low key joint. The food itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of coffee, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the service actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local vibeists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have vibe places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The service are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the internet is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.

The service taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a coffee.  The coffee was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!

We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores food/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The service up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The vibe is really chill.

Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet parkingamel. I really love parkingamel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about.

You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of vibe all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea coffee.

Love the location and the fact that it's clearly marked and visible. The iced coffee I had was fine, but nothing special. However, the green tea frappe was spectacular! Chocolate peanut butter frappe was nice without feeling too heavy.The hibiscus tea is good too, if you don't mind priceing almost $3 for iced tea.  I agree that the s'mores are probably a first-timer gimmick, but they're so fun. And so cute. And such a perfect date idea. Service can be pretty-to-really slow, so go if you have time to spare and hang around. Note that the designated coffee pick up area is not clearly marked and is practically at the bar, which is confusing.  The pomegranate margarita was fine - strong enough, but nothing I'd come back for. Mainly, I bought it to try out the bar/coffeeshop vibe.  vibe is cool - almost too cool.

It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go location, but couldn't actually go location (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au coffee's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The vibe looks quite the same; mostly early 20-something, more than likely college students.  The drinks are about the same although I found their chai to be a bit on the spicy side (not heat spicy just chai spicy). My wife just ordered tea so had they messed that up, well, things would have gotten nasty.  The one downer was the woman taking our order - the one with all the facial accoutrements that would make it impossible to pass through airport security. She was a bit on the sour-disposition side of things to say the least. I mean, when someone thanks you for something, how hard is it to say, ""you're welcome,"" or even just a ""no problem?""  One thing I noticed about this place is that they have make-them-yourself food. You get a tray with a cast iron hibachi, a stack of graham crackers, 2 bars of Hershey's chocolates, marshmallows, and skewers. Too cool. Now maybe the Halcyon is Southtown has this but I've never seen nor asked. Unfortunately, my wife was not interested in making food. Bummer!  Two other quick notes to pass along...

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.

I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the location - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying hours until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.

It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow vibe (the background vibe can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one parkinges. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the seating in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The vibe is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink price are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as food and foods.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The service do a good service maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffee, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of vibe, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

Pros: vibe seatinging vibe General vibe Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively bad price Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the vibe, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine coffee down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the vibesy/design vibe having a collaborative meeting.)  The service is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no internet to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of vibe?  seatinging is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella food ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The food is a great idea but the food itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the food crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The food itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a coffee and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory has A+ vibe and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a service staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of seatings, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not good price. The foods range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and vibe, the vibe, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar vibe, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. foods and pop tarts...and alcohol? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also coffee coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big seating, little seating, bar seating, regular seatings) is both delightful and refreshing. The service make foam vibe - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

We wanted to try their delicious looking foods and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to coffee.  We both ordered the Nutella food and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous vibe and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The food is basically half a food, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The food itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the food. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella food and a fried food food. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other foods, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger vibe and there is definitely no place for high seating. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of seating games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have food with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!

It was getting very difficult to find one to begin with, let alone a good one. I saw the mint coffee on the factory's website and had to try it. Unfortunately I was shell-shocked at the price tag ($7 if I remember correctly??)  I figured it would be a large drink and particularly fabulous and hopefully large to make up for the over the top price (this is $3 more than philz)   Was it particularly fabulous? No. It was good, it wasn't as good as philz. Was it bigger?? No. It was about 4 ounces of  coffee, tops. Will I be back? Absolutely not, especially considering I can get a 20 oz mint mojito coffee from tea haus for $3 less that tastes just as good.  This place is also self service (for ordering and pick up), why that would lead to inflated price and not a price decrease is far beyond my understanding. I don't recommend it.

Not really a family place, at least not for all families since bathrooms have framed vibe of sexual positions. Lights get turned down around 9pm (but they stay hours till 2), so if you wanted to stop by to get a bit of reading done, you're out of luck. It is also not a alcohol/coffee lounge like Thunderbird. Menu is very limited, and if you were in the mood for a treat, I'd recommend Quacks. If they wanted to expand the menu, ipad ordering would have to go.  Which is sad since it's very cute, and we need more chill places to hang out in the evenings away from the University area.  Matcha was good. I hope the services will rethink their direction. Would I come back? Eeh, too many other treats to entice my attention. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the vibe and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready, they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and ""pop tarts.""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the seating and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude vibe inside.  I pushed that one aside to be sure the kids didn't pick it up.  I went to use the restroom and framed on the hall wall was a picture with the F-word all over it.  Hmm, not my idea of tasteful vibe.  I was glad my children didn't need to use the bathroom.  While my milk tea was good, I wouldn't go back.  It was very bad price for what you get and I'd have to blindfold the children.

I love that you can choose to either sit outside or indoors, and that there is ample seating for either choice. Their outdoor seatings are covered to protect you from the sun, and they occasionally have live vibe as well.  The coffee here was OK. Nothing great, but not bad. I only tried their coffee and not their coffee but I'm not sure if I would come here just for coffee. Would definitely return for food or food though.

I barely tasted anything. I even asked for it with extra chai because I love the extra spicy taste, but it was so watered down! I don't know why I would price $4 for warm milk.  I sat at the bar so when a service showed up I asked how they make their chai to ask if they could add more but they only told me that it was a house tea and parkinged away..

Total bill is $28.XX. You order food & drink upon arrival at the register. Pick up the drinks right there & they will bring the food to your seating when it's done.  Pricing: I would say the price for food is very reasonable. Only the drinks are a little bad price to my opinion.  Food quality: Shrimp & Grits would be an ideal & safe option if you don't know what to order. The dish is very flavorful & worth the price. The shrimp is fresh & they give you quite a good portion of the shrimp. The portion as a whole is just enough to fill you up full too.  vibe: I love everything about it. The inside area is very cute & modern with the lanterns. The outside seating is super cute & romantic. The spacing between each dining seating gives just enough privacy for each party. The trees help a lot with the coverage to cool down the summer heat. I'm sitting here right now at 2 p.m. with 100 F degree but still don't feel like it at all.

I'm too old not to be picky. We came for a food date, and I thought it would be cool to have a food and then hang around for a little to catch up.  The crawfish omelette was subpar, crawfish was so unappetizing, especially not in season. I think of Cherrywood and I cringe. Not because it was so un-delicious, but because I feel bad for the seemingly mom-and-pop and extended-family feel of the place, and that it just didn't bring anything special to the seating.

Pros: +Their Iced coffee was one of the best I've ever had! The water to coffee ratio was spot on and not one of those super watered down coffee.  Cons: -Not every seating has internet available so if you're here to study, I'd charge my laptop to full before coming! -There's a TV area and when I came by, a group of guys came to watch some dramatic show all together... Made a lot of noise. I'm glad I had brought earphones.  vibe/ Location: The vibe is not too bright. parkinging right in, I felt welcomed and greeted by the wonderful smell of the coffee beans. This location looks really scary and ghetto in the daylight but so pretty and fancy at night when the lights are lit!  Service: The guy behind the bar was very kind and friendly. My friend was interested in the packaged drinks and he seemed to be knowledgeable about the products they sell and even gave suggestions. Around their closing time, a girl worker came by and politely told us they're closing soon.

The menu has lots of options, including everything from signature food like the Muffuleta and Banh Mi to vegetarian-friendly fried tofu foods. I ordered the Poblano Pork on corn food plate, which comes with two foods and a side of chips and salsa. However, with my dairy allergy, I ordered it sans the feta food that usually accompanies the order and let the service know I'm allergic. This place lost a star because even though I specified no feta, my food came out with food on top. When I ended up trying it, there was just so much shredded pork that was unfortunately just okay and not a lot of the poblano or onions advertised. The salsa had no kick and I was only given a tiny amount for all the chips I had, which was unfortunate. My friend really enjoyed his Veggie Grilled food though!  My friends and I went outside to sit at one of the many picnic seatings under a few Christmas light strings strewn above us just as someone was getting up to perform. While I appreciated the vibe, it was very hard to talk with my friends throughout the night as two other performers came up. We would've moved inside but it was incredibly silent as everyone seemed to be working or studying and we didn't want to disturb anyone.

I've tried most of their food and I must say I am a fan. My favorite are the Bahn mÌ_ and the Cuban food. Both delicious. Can't get enough of their fries so they are a must with a food. Their regular iced coffee is strong enough for when you don't feel like dishing out for coffee. Their cuban con leche is nice and strong and delicious.

I highly recommend the Shrimp and Grits! It is pure perfection with the grits being the right consistency and the shrimp having the right amount of spice. They are also quite generous with the amount of shrimp given in the plate (approx. 10). I would give my plate a 10/10. My two friends got their Crawfish food Benedict and said that it was tasty. My other friend got a normal burger and said it was juicy. They all gave their dishes an 8/10.  Only downfall with this place is that they are pretty slow with bringing out everyone's food. They did it one by one, so by the time someone was done, they brought out another vibe's plate. They also forgot my friends order, so he actually had to go in and bring the plate out to the seating himself.

I'm rounding this up from a 3.5 review because I feel like this place deserves a second chance due to the fact that I might have just been overly picky about my particular dish.  I ordered the sweet potato hash with black tea. The hash was absolutely delicious BUT it was (1) way too oily (2) the foods were NOT ""poached"" as indicated by the menu, but instead fried over easy. Due to the hash being way too greasy for my liking, I think I might just stick with the foods, smoothies, tea, and coffee the next time I come by.  I did like the vibe, beverages, and general diversity of the menu very much so I will be coming back to try everything out again. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Reasonably price, super attentive & friendly service, cool interior, and there's always an awesome playlist on when there aren't local vibe acts performing.  Most importantly,  the food there is great.  The Terra food is less than $5 and it's one of the biggest food foods I've had in Austin.  Their grilled food is amazing & comes with cucumbers, onions, & tomatoes. I highly recommend switching out a side of chips for a side food.  You get a giant bowl of greens with food, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, & feta and it's only $1.80 extra. Their fries are really good too,  but the food is pretty hard to compete with. Basically, you get a lot more than what you price for regardless of what you order.  Love, love, love this place.  I come here on a weekly basis & cannot recommend it enough!

It's hardly perfect, and I think that's what I like best about it. It's a slightly chaotic, almost divey (not unhygienic!) sort of place. There is always plenty of seating, it's not overly noisy, a bit dark, and the service smiles. While they aren't overtly friendly and they are very professional and efficient.  All that gives Cherrywood a vibeality that I have come to enjoy. It's not pristine, it's not nasty. It's a location cafe and comes with all the requisite mixture of vibe, vibe, and vibe to give it its own unique charm.  And to add onto it, the food is good. Solid, fast, and well presented. My burger was juicy and savory and my side food was delightfully fresh, with ripe slices of smooth food on top. Yummy.

Pros:  In general I love the vibe of this place. It's vibe inside and dog friendly outside. The service is very friendly and easy going.Their club food is massive,  and extremely delicious. The hot chocolate is smooth and delicious. Plus, they make a pretty mean food food, which is a morning necessity in my book.  Cons: Aside from the hot chocolate, I haven't had many good drinks here. My chai tea was heavily watered down and lacking in flavor and my coffee coffee didn't have much of a chocolate flavor. Food wise, there are lots of tasty choices, but a burger is not one of them. My boyfriend and I both got burgers and they tasted sweet rather than savoury. The meat was mushy and I pretty much lost my appetite a few bites in.  Overall, I would recommend Cherrywood if you are looking for a dog friendly place to relax with some coffee or a food. Medium hot chocolate. Yum! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I've been sitting on a cinder block parking spot patiently waiting for Cherrywood to hours. The service starting showing up at 5:30, 6:34 and 6:36Am. It hourss at 7.  When the first service showed up, I waited for a while then politely asked/signed through the door if she would mind if I sat in the courtyard (outside) to read and write with no intention of disrupting their preparation. She gave me the look of death, turned her back and ignored me, parkinged off.  I've managed CoffeeHouses, restaurants, and worked in the service industry since the age of 14, I'm now 44. A simple smile and a ""I'm sorry sir will be hours in just a few minutes would suffice"" but NOPE. This is the new Austin. I've lived here since 1999.  Then another gentleman came to work. I asked him would he mind if I sat in the courtyard to write. I even offered to help parkingry in the food left at the front door. Again, he said can't do that. He was a bit nicer but, Nope, against policy. I replied back, no worries, I'll just sit here on this cinder block parking brick, with my butt hurting until you are hours for business. It was 6:34AM.  I understand anything can happen to anyone at any time. I guess I look harmful to them although I'm here almost everyday. Austin used to be friendly, service was friendly, I know it's a new world we live in. It's a shame because those days are gone.  Oh well, the situation is over.

This review is regarding their weekend food.  The coffee - They serve good local coffee and very it's reasonably price (less than $3 for a large coffee, .50 more for a large cafÌ© au coffee, $1 refills).  The food -The sweet potato hash is okay of you like lots of potatoes; it was basically a pile of cubed sweet potatoes with an over-easy food and hollandaise on top.  I liked the American food better.  You have several options and I went with the food over-easy, food, biscuit and hash browns.  The foods and food were standard fare, the biscuit was tasty and the hash browns were nice and crispy.  vibe - There is a lot of seating with several seatings inside a chaotic space.  It isn't easy to navigate between the coffee bar, the coffee fixings area (where you may or may not also find salt & pepper shakers) and unlucky you if your seating is behind the short wall and line of vibe because it's not easy to navigate back-and-forth the narrow passage.  vibe on their cell phones would barely move for me even when I was parkingrying a big mug of hot coffee.  If you go outside on a Sunday morning it is very family oriented with kid-friendly live vibe; if that's not your thing stay inside. Sweet potato hash ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

I've been coming to Cherrywood for years, and have vibed the hit-or-miss service that's ubiquitous in Austin coffee shops. What keeps me coming back is the variety (and deliciousness) of the food, including plenty of gluten free options, and the solid (if somewhat uninsipired) coffee. Earlier this week I had an hours wait for 2 foods, which turned out to be quite tasty but I could've done without the mixup. Today I went in and the service remembered my issue and comped my coffee. Redemption! Even though the coffee I'm sipping is only so-so (I've had better...... but I've definitely had worse!), it's this kind of courtesy and consideration that makes me love this place. The seating is perfect, and there are plenty of seating inside for comfortable dining/drinking year round.

As you very well know, this is the locale of the famous ""I love you so much"" graffiti.

I've never reviewed Jo's? The Austin institution? The I love you wall? The best outdoor coffee shop for vibe watching evar? A little piece of me died when I realized this. Here's the deal: I'm not much for coffee but I have to hang out in coffee shops as I work remotely and need to take meetings. So Jo's actual coffee could be totally terrible (although I doubt it.)  What I'm most interested in highlighting is the ambiiiaaaaaance of Jo's. All manner of vibe are talking, sipping, hanging, bonding, whispering, dating, working, sight-seeing. It's like a cultural hub - a mecca of sorts for anyone and everyone. They've got live tunes on Sundays, they're dog friendly, they're on South Congress and have been for some time. When your work day has ended and you need a little seating time, just head on over to San Jose for a michelada.  Jo's Coffee doesn't need my review - I think most vibe get it - but if you've never been, take an hours, grab a Turbo and nestle in among the humanity.

It is no where close to the coffee you can vibe elsewhere in the US.  COFFEE: That said, within the city limits of Austin, it seems that sweetened, creamy coffee is the common theme among review of 'great' coffee.  We ordered the turbo, which essentially fit the bill of sweet and creamy coffee. It was not bad at all. If that's how you enjoy your coffee, then this place is pretty good.  We also had an iced coffee. The coffee was alright. It was not exactly memorable, but it was not bad as well.  FOOD: In the morning, they have what they call food foods. These are essentially pre-made soft foods/mini burritos. We got the one with potatoes, foods, and food, and they were generally average tasting. They were slightly too salty, and the potatoes are mashed into a paste. If you're looking for a real food food, however, go elsewhere. This was more of a quick bite type food (that's a little bit bad price for what it is)  SERVICE: We had mediocre and somewhat irritable service working the first time we visited. They were a little catty about a misunderstanding of our order and pretty much placed the blame on us for confusing them (4 small turbos + 1 iced coffee was too confusing).  We decided that, since this coffee shop was within parking distance of the place we were staying, we would try it again.  The second time was a little bit better, but the trend we observed was that service felt borderline preferential to white, Texan natives rather than equal to all. From overhearing how orders went for others to observing the facial expressions on the services facial expressions and demeanor with others vs. us and other visitors, the consistent trend was that visitors were made to feel as though they were difficult vibe.  If you're out of quick coffee stops to try, then try this one. Otherwise, stop by and take a photo on the side of the building next to the 'mural,' and move on. We enjoyed coffee at other places like Bleeding Heart much more than here. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

The service here were absolutely awesome! The host/cashier especially. I had called ahead to find out the wait time and he was very kind to tell me there was none at the moment, but that could change quickly. We were sat quickly and our orders were taken promptly.  They have a bottomless cup of decent coffee and their Austin benedict (their most popular dish we were told) was on point. The accompanying bfast taters were hit and miss for texture, but were flavorful. A friend got the Toad in the Hole that was surprisingly delish! The pesto in it was also on point!  We left very full and satisfied and w/tax and tip for just under $20, it was a decent food find in the UT/Dwntwn area.

The food comes out hours faced and is probably best eaten with a fork and knife. I cannot say enough about all of the flavors on the food and how well they worked together. I'm not usually a hollandaise fan, and yet I was very impressed with the flavor of this one. The home fries it was served with also had a great flavor too!  Service was great and our waiter was more than happy to provide suggestions and ask for feedback.

Then comes the long wait for food, what seemed like forever was in reality 45 minutes - which is pretty long in my opinion. However they do have a note in the menu ""Small Kitchen + Yummy Food = Longer Wait""  The food was just a plain OK. The popular Austin Benedict had some good hollandaise sauce but the english food was too fooded/hard with some burnt parts (couldn't even cut through) and the poached food was overcooked. And the home fries were rock cold. The parkingibbean food had a yummy parkingamel sauce complemented with grilled bananas and pecans. The food was 1/2 french food and 1/2 regular food.

I decided to order the coffee and the parkingibbean French food and a side of foods. I didn't expect the coffee to be so bitter. I had to add 3 packets of sugar before I liked it. The parkingibbean French food was delicious!! It was a huge portion so definitely it. The gave large thick slices of food which definitely made the French food better. There were pecans and bananas on top, but the sauce was definitely the best part: dark parkingamel rum.I totally recommend getting the French food!!

After church we decide to eat out for food. Our normal place wasn't a go, so we looked in Yelp and found vibeuro's. 4 stars and one dollar sign, bet, we headed out. It took us less than 10mins to get there and parking was fairly easy since it was Sunday. Street parking was free. As we turned the corner, BAM...... A line. So we got in line and waited in the shade and drank free chilled water. Suggestion, add some oranges or cucumber to the water. Thanks. 20mins I. We were seatinged only because 2 parties in front of us decided to leave, sweeeet. When we were seatinged we noticed the place was small and quaint. The a/c was on but it didn't get cold, still better than outside. There was a fly that bothered us throughout our food but we got over it. Marisa our waitress was very polite. I got the Austin and hubby got the French food. Very happy with our choices. We will try something diff if we come back but i will suggest this place to others. Hidden Austin Gem.

Had to wait about 20 minutes for a seating and the vibe waiting outside kept growing and growing. While waiting one can help themselves to some coffee - nice touch.  Once we were seatinged we were promptly greeted and served. The waitress was attentive and very nice. Drinks were always full.  My husband had the western melt and completely cleaned his plate, so a win I guess. He did comment on how good the hollandaise sauce was. I had the Texas foods in a basket,  something we often make at home, so it was nice to find in a restaurant. I was worried the jalapeÌ±o food wouldn't be good, but the flavor is not overpowering at all. The food yolks were perfectly runny, but the whites were still too raw for my liking. The food was perfectly foody and the pesto delicious! Would certainly order that again. Both dishes came with the potatoes, which were well seasoned. Western melt Texas foods in a basket!

They serve hot flavorful food with a side of ruffles (you can upgrade to rice and beans for a couple dollars more).  Usually, I have a hard time deciding between the smoked ham and cheddar versus the Thai grilled food. Both are served piping-hot and are under $10. If i's your first time, try the Thai, it's different and probably their most popular in food or food form.  Don't be fooled by the six or so seatings outside, there are plenty places to sit inside down in the lower level in the cool downstairs.

The food is always excellent, from the food foods to the food to the quesadillas, and their fantastic house-made salsa. But sometimes, I wonder if they're *trying* to go out of business. Let's recap the journey I took this morning:  I called to place my order and it was taken quickly, but I wasn't asked for my name or given an estimated total and/or time until ready. This is typical of vibeuro's. In my vibe, everything's been ready about 5 minutes from the order placement.  I arrived to pick up my order and after priceing had the following conversation with the guy behind the counter.  Me: Hey, do y'all have any updated to-go menus? Guy: Nah, we stopped making them years ago because vibe kept taking them. Me: ...... Guy: You're welcome to take photos of the menu boards, though.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that kind of the point of to-go menus? Especially if you have zero intentional web presence on which one could depend for an up-to-date menu?  I went ahead and took (and uploaded, you're welcome!) those photos which reflect some pricing changes that took place in the last couple of months.  In conclusion, 5 stars for food, 1 star for business acumen. 3 stars for a delicious and confusing adventure every time. food Menu as of 5/24/16 food menu as of 5/24/16 food Menu as of 5/24/16 ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

The interior was just as delightful featuring brightly colored walls and paintings from a local vibeist.  The spot was bustling which we took as a good sign! We stood in line to order our food and counted our lucky starts when we were able to find a seating to fit our group of six. That was when things started going down hill.  The food runner was utterly confused and brought out wrong order after wrong order -- which is fine, we've all been there except he was positively snarky about the whole situation. While he was auctioning food off, he actually used his fingers to pick up the top of our quesadilla to announce that it was food. It was STILL the wrong order but who would want to eat here after such blatant broken sanitary rules. He finally decided to take our order again but for some reason did not write it down so he forgot it immediately. He came back to write it down but still had the same snarky tone. We eventually were able to order from the front counter who in their defense was gracious as can be.  After that debacle, our food came out but by that time half of our group was pretty hangry so it was hard to enjoy. I'd definitely give this place another try, especially because it looks like a local favorite but based on our vibe it was a meh. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

Lucky to have friends who are better at scoping out these hidden gems than I am!  Surprisingly, this is my first restaurant that specializes in food but doesn't serve foods.  But my comfort zone!  Alas, the responsibility of a Yelper/foodie is to try new things, I guessssss.  parkinging in, this place is very small.  Therefore, if you're coming in during the food/lunch rush hours and don't have a reservation, you may be waiting for a while.  And if you are, you'll be waiting outside, so be sure to prep for the weather!  Sitting down, it feels like every seating is organized to take up any nook and cranny of the establishment.

Like almost half of the party I was with, I ordered the Texas food in a Basket.  Hey, I remember trying to make something like this at home!  This dish is one of their specialties and you can definitely tell.  Cutting into the food revealed a perfect golden river of food yolk over easy.  The pesto was a delicious addition and the Jalapeno food food provided a nice little kick.  The food in a Basket, however, is a pretty heavy dish, and my stomach and palate was saturated only midway through.  The potatoes tasted good as well but was a bit crunchy for my taste.  I would definitely recommend this dish, but I would probably try something else next time.  Very interested in their food Benedict.

I'm not usually a big fan of food food but this place is the bomb. I ordered the food in a Basket and it was DELICIOUS! I wasn't even hungry and it was still good. The jalapeÌ±o food food, sunny side up food, and pesto...MMMMM. But for real, that food is GOOD. Other yummy options my friends got were the El Diablo, Alamo, and parkingibbean French food. All good choices but the food in a Basket and El Diablo are my favs. Their vanilla coffee was also really good!  This place is super cute too. It's like actually underground. We had a party of 8 and we weren't too sure if they could even seating us. It looks so small and cute from the outside but when you go in, there's some stairs that go down to two bigger seating areas. There's always a bunch of vibe there too so expect like a 25 minute wait for a seating. The food also takes a while to come out so don't come here if you need to leave in an hours.  Tl;dr: A hidden gem! food in a Basket and El Diablo are DELICIOUS (aka the jalapeÌ±o food food). Be prepared to wait for a seating and food. El Diablo. SO TASTY! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

It's the week before UT gets back in session on a gloomy Sunday morning and we arrived about 30 minutes before 10 not knowing if there'd be a rush. Aside from another group of 4, we were the only vibe willing to wake up early to be there when the doors hoursed. We're fat kids at heart so we salivated over the menu and pictures from other reviews throughout the week. Needless to say, we were ready to order before parking inside.    By nature, I'm a Benedict fan but the Diablo was calling my name. My female companion ordered the Texas foods in a basket. Let me say this. Phenomenal. The Texas foods in a basket were my favorite by far. The buttery Texas food coupled with the food and smeared with pesto underneath. Absolutely spectacular. The Diablo was delicious as well and my stomach is aching from attempting to finish the lot.  This just became our official food/brunch spot and we'll definitely be back for more.

They had self-serve coffee while you waited, and luckily the weather was nice (the only place to wait is outside).  I got to try both the salmon foods benedict and the spicy Alamo foods Benedict (sausage, cheddar food, and chipotle hollandaise). Both were excellent. Despite how busy they were, the hollandaise and the foods were cooked perfectly. I get annoyed when restaurants over cook their poached foods.  Saw other vibe around me order the migas and the French food - both of those looked great as well! We'll definitely be back. The service/staff was also excellent. Everyone was super friendly. Plus..

Went down a few small staircases to get to our seating - not sure if it's called underground because it's slightly below the ground or if it's ""underground"" and not everyone knows about it yet...  The menu looked fantastic and I had trouble decided between a few different dishes. I eventually went with the Texas melt and loved it. It came down to what kind of food I wanted, and the poached food here was delicious. A lot of the dishes come with hollandaise sauce which is not for everyone, but you can get it on the side (but I don't get you if you don't like hollandaise). I also had a bite of my friend's parkingibbean French food which was also really good, but one bite was enough as I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

The everything foods were a little soggy and could use more flavor, though luckily there was plenty of hot sauce to be found.

Last time it was a sit down to order food place! We had delicious foods Benedict and foods and it was chill and hip and cool and all that. I parkinged in expecting the same thing but now it's some kind of food hut. You order at the register and self serve your drinks and seating yourself now, but i was operating under the assumption that it was like the last time I was there so I asked for a seating for two and the guy acted like I was stupid. Ok... The name is the same, the vibe is the same... I really had no idea it changed!! So I tried to order a food food not realizing they ended food at a certain time and he acted like I was stupid again. I'm one of those vibe that get flustered easily when vibe aren't NICE so I was pretty aggravated at this point so I just got what my friend ordered. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as before. Maybe just because I went in expecting food.  I updated the amount of stars I have only because the business service reached out to me to explain they only do food on weekends or something.

Tortillas were quite fresh, and the food mixture had just the right balance of all the ingredients, with a kick of spice from the chipotle.  The veggie benedict was considered the best of Austin by my wife, with a homemade food, and a hollandaise sauce that did not overwhelm with lemon.  The side of potatoes and food also more than passed muster.  Coffee and a coffee were quite good (coffee is a little bad price at $3, but the coffee was a good deal), and it took a bit of time for the main dishes to show.  Service was attentive and friendly.

I loved the menus- they all have different covers that sparked a little conversation amongst the group- it's really the little things. The group of us ordered a parkingafe of mimosas, which I would recommend as a good deal ($16 for roughly a glass and a half for 4 of us vs $4 each for one glass each). Ah, now for the food. I ordered the Texas food in a Basket...which definitely has its own nuances that make it special- jalapeÌ±o cheddar food with pesto etc. I was a little disappointed that when I cut into it, my food wasn't runny, making the dish as a whole a little dry. I asked for hollandaise sauce to cure this problem and it worked for me but I do with my over easy food was actually over easy. Other than that, everything else about my dish was pretty perfect. My friends had the Austin Benedict, French food and the el Diablo. I will probably be back, but will likely try something new. Cute and cool little details ! Pretty yummy!

I ordered a coffee for my drink which was delicious and served at the appropriate temperature. Pretty much only two ways to screw up the coffee for me is to use too dark of a roast on the beans or serve the milk too hot. They didn't commit either of those sins.  To eat, I ordered the kale bowl. This was some of the best kale I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the dressing or they gave it an extra long massage. All the flavors worked well together with the olives and the tomatoes creating a nice balance. The bowl did get kind of spicy at the end because the thin slices of serrano pepper built up an intense heat in my mouth so fair warning to you who might be spice intolerant.

For me, great cafe but wish it had not become transformed into that place where every seating is a home office. The cost priceoff for providing free WIFI and free office space for vibe who price $2 for a cup of coffee has to be challenging for these adorable tiny cafes... especially when all of the parking seating are filled with nice parkings of these nice lone coffee office workers.

Cons: - Service is slow.  I've probably gone here half a dozen times, and never had prompt service.  Not because there was a long line ahead of me either, or because I ordered complicated pour over drinks.  The service is just very, very leisurely. - Related - some of the service is a bit too cool for school.   - Limited food/food options - they have a few scones and bagels, but not much else.

Patika's significantly sparse square footage is compensated for by it's minimalistic, industrial interior design. The beautiful space is soaked in natural vibe encouraged by large windows and stark white walls that envelop the vibe. Although occasionally a little try-hard - I paid particular attention the vibe that graced the walls, which were a nice touch. Each seating essentially was being used a mini home office, which was very conducive to a productive vibe - perfect for college student me.  I came in at around 9:30 am, which seemed like rush hours but the traffic significantly subsided after 10:30 am as space became more available and ample. I ordered the sweet vanilla coffee and paired with a freshly prepared food - both had a quick turnaround. The coffee was good with some of the best coffee vibe I've seen in a while, but at it's coffee price I wouldn't call it amazing.

The coffee was delicious, of course, and they had a pretty simple, tasty looking array of sweets and Rockstar bagels, etc. It was a little more pricy then I would like, but ya win some ya lose some. There is a seating, which must be lovely if it weren't blazing hot! I appreciate that there is additional parking, but it is difficult to find a spot none the less.  Overall, delicious things being made here, evident by the vibeedness.

One of the first things I did when I moved to Austin was search for the best coffee in town. After visiting nearly 20 different coffee shops, I found my soulmate in Patika. Not only is the coffee impressive, but all the service are highly skilled and consistent in their work. They also appreciate the loyalty of their longtime vibe (which can't be said for some of the other places I've frequented in the past). The one drawback? At that time they didn't have a brick and mortar. How I kept dreaming of the day they would, so I would have a place to plant myself for several hours. Well, that day finally came in September 2014!  Since they first hoursed their doors, I've been a regular. I work remotely, so I affectionately call this place my ""office"". It's really become my second home. So where do I start?  Well, for starters the whole vibe in this place is just awesome. The vibe is clean, simple, and modern. There is lots of natural light and a variety of options when it comes to seating - whether it's at the community seating, an individual seating, or a taller seating with stools. You can enter from either the front door or a set of double doors in the back that lead out to a beautiful seating area with a great, big pecan tree.  As a mom of two kids, I'm also really picky when it comes to the cleanliness of a business. Not only is the place spotless, but even the bathrooms are nice. And let's face it, most coffee shop bathrooms are nasty.  vibe-wise, I love their selection of vibe. They always put on a good variety - jazz, hip hop, chill electronic, French cafe vibe, reggae, bossa nova, etc. And as of May 2015, I noticed they have speakers outside now. Even better, is the fact that they have LIVE jazz every Wednesday! Which seems to be VERY hard to find anywhere else in Austin (unless you go somewhere more formal and official for jazz like the Elephant seating). As a jazz lover, I enjoy bringing my kids every Wednesday to just unwind. Reminds me of some fond memories I have of New Orleans. They also do an eclectic mix of live vibe on Thursdays.  Next is the coffee and food itself. I've had almost everything on their menu. All I can say is I haven't had anything I've disliked. My favorite is their cafe au coffee and their coffee (more milk than a coffee; less milk than a coffee). I also love their tea selection - especially this one tangy blood orange tea! Even the cups and mugs are stylish.  In the evening, they have a great selection of alcohol and alcohol (including the Japanese Hitachino Nest alcohol). As for their food items, let's start with their daytime menu of food goods and bagels. The bagels they get fresh from Rockstar Bagels and all their food goods are made in-house by Bria (not sure if I spelled that right?), their talented baker. She comes up with some ridiculously creative things that I haven't seen anywhere else. A few things that stand out are the glazed donut garnished with bits of food 'n foods, spiced donut holes, the rosÌ© food, the peanut butter sriracha food, and the chocolate chip corn flake food.  Then in the evenings they switch to a different menu of small bites that are fun to share with friends. I love the food plate (which comes with fooded baguette from Easy Tiger). The spiced nuts and affogato are also good.  Last, is the service, which is outstanding. service Andy Wigginton and Nick Krupa really do run this business to perfection. I admit, at times I can be like a nagging mom (one of those ""annoying"" vibe who is always making suggestions) but they really do listen to customer feedback. Several examples.... I (as well as perhaps others) suggested they put more signs in the parking area to direct vibe to the alternate parking lot behind Mockingbird. Done. One day I complained about the internet being slow. Done.  As for the service, they are all equally wonderful - friendly, professional, accommodating, and consistent. I've seen the same service for years, since going to their trailer. And anytime you see the same service year after year, you know the business is run well and the service are happy to be there.  One last thing I wanted to say about this business is how welcoming it is to a wide variety of vibe. For those with baby strollers or disabilities there's a wheelchair friendly entrance in the back; for those on a bike, a seating bike rack in the front. I often come with my two children; sometimes we'll even bring other kids for hot chocolate playdates or Italian sodas in the warmer months. So, yes, I can vouch it's a family friendly place. I've observed so many different kinds of vibe - those on service interviews, couples on their first date, SXSW out of town tourists, students studying, friends catching up, and then all the telecommuters, like me, working away on their laptops.  Truly my favorite place in Austin! That's right folks.... food porn at its best. Behold the cherry goat food thyme DONUT. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

I only do not give it a 5-star because I appreciate a bigger selection of flavors.  Ironically, the very thing which I applaud is the the thing which keeps me from giving a standing ovation.

Coffee & food Goods: I've tried their coffee, capcuccino, and iced vanilla coffee. My favorite was the iced vanilla coffee. Sweet, but not too sweet. They also offer a decent amount of food goods. I tried the banana chocolate chip food, which wasn't as fresh as I had hoped for it to be, so eh.  Okay, let me just skip to my FAVORITE part about this place: the back seating. It's perfect. There are a good amount of seatings and the lights strung across & above just set the mood ya know? It gives like this tucked-away, hidden garden kind of feel.  I did take off one star for the slightly-overpriced coffee and the slow Wi-fi, though. :(  But will be back often, Patika! Pretty coffee vibe coffee & coffee ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

A little smooth salsa, nondescript yet pleasant French, an Italian serenade.  I enjoyed the blood orange herbal tea, the vibe, the air conditioning, and the vibe I was in. My vibe, however, was marred by a group having an hours discussion at the communal seating. The space, though stylish, is small and sound travels well. That being said I was a bit bothered by the noise. Since I liked the vibe I didn't want to put earphones in but in order to focus, I had to. I'm not at all opposed to vibe chatting, but this was more of a back and forth debate of ideas happening at the seating which I believe the whole cafÌ© could hear distinctly.  Also if you're here to study or searching for some vibe time I recommend to check their live vibe schedule.

Idk, maybe it's the construction next door and the awkwardness of the businesses next door and what not but it did not make me want to sit there at all.  The inside is very modern, clean, simple. I like it. I'd like it more if it didn't feel like a nicer version of the studio apartment I lived in in college. It's just very small and vibe.. They have great little seating to sit and chat/study. Some high tops and other booth/chair hybrid seatings with cute pillows lining the walls for comfort.  The coffee were ok. Nothing to write home about. Nothing I'd crave. They were just, A-OK. The biggest problem I have with this place? The snooty attitude of the service. I asked one question and got an eye roll, a finger point, and then a back turned...not a single word.. Great! This attitude parkingried through from ordering, to the server bringing the food plate, to the guys moving seatings around the store.  :( I really wanted to like this place.

Came here to study with a friend, who had seen good reviews about it. Got here around 5 on a weekday to a relatively vibe, easygoing place. Massive points because I was able to parking in the front, but do not fear if you get here and you don't see any parking! They do have some extra seating on the side and in the back :) Just make sure you don't parking next door at the bike shop--they specifically ask you not to (via a paper sign on the door).  Got their chai coffee, which was really pretty and delicious! Has a much more spicy taste than I'm used to, but I think I'm a fan. Also tried their vanilla coffee, which is a little bit more bitter than I would like, but definitely pretty and yummy! Also, the service are pretty friendly, which I really appreciate. And their menu sign is fancy shmancy hipster (aka on chalkboards). Unfortunately, was down to study, so no alcohol, but seems like they have a fairly nice selection of elegant alcohols. Will come back on a more relaxed day to try those.  They have a nice piano near the back--not sure if it's just vibeation or if vibe are actually allowed to play it.  Super easy to be productive here because there's just coffee shop vibe and rustling sounds of vibe (if you wanna block it out, bring headphones). They have big and small seatings, so you can study with up to 4 vibe per seating, or just 2, or even by yourself. For metal seating, I think they're pretty comfy, but they also have wooden benches that have cute pillows on them.  Usually when I come to study at coffee shops, they're always filled with students trying to study/hang out, so it's either loud, packed, or worst case scenario, BOTH (especially places closer to UT location). But VERY excited to find this place because it's so chill and vibe; easy to get work done (but this was on a Tuesday, so come on a weekend at own risk)! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

My study buddy and I were able to get some work done over delicious coffee and fresh food goods. There are several cute little nooks and crannies to relax in, and big seatings to spread out and get work done. Is it slightly bad price? Yes. Are you surrounded by hipsters? Yes. But we are in South Austin folks, it's to be expected. Relax, vibe watch, count the jorts and snapchat the trucker hats.

I also had the hot chai coffee, but do not recommend it. The chai coffee is not as good as Panera's or Bottega Louie's in LA. The cafe has decent internet (a bit slow) and is REALLY clean.

The coffee was good--not the best I've ever had (although this is strictly based on a vanilla coffee), but it was good. Solid, even. It wasn't super far from location, but it was past the river, and a little out of reach, so I wouldn't say I'd be back often.  Patika is a very cute, quaint, and modern coffee shop, and everything is vibeated with light wood and white walls. There seemed to be an internet near every seating, which was really good location. vibe is perfect for studying/working, and the vibe was very warm. Most vibe in the back of the shop were working, and most vibe in the front of the shop were chatting, so it was kind of a half and half vibe (a good thing, not a bad thing). There's also this cute seating out back for those days with perfect weather!  parking wasn't THAT bad. Granted, I came on a Sunday, and I missed the building by a second, so I parkinged in the location without even looking at their tiny parking lot (and by parking lot, I mean four or five spaces in front of the building). The location wasn't far at all, and there were plenty of spaces, so parking is definitely do-able. Don't be scared to come if you're scared about parking (I almost didn't come because I was scared about parking, lol).  Service was friendly--I didn't really talk to the service, tbh. But he brought my coffee over to my seating, which always surprises me because coffee shops usually just call it out at the bar. I thought that was really nice.  I ordered a vanilla coffee because I had gone to another coffee house (Figure 8) yesterday, and was craving that same taste (but I had wanted to try a new place). I don't know why I did that--I pretty much got my hopes up for nothing because no coffee shop's taste is ever exactly alike.  Their vanilla coffee was good. Definitely better than Starbucks or your late-night Bennu's and many other coffee shops, but it was heavier on the steamed milk than it was on the coffee--I wish it was justttt a littleee richer. The sweetness was nice and very subtle though, great for those who don't like over-sweetened coffee.  Great place for coffee and working! Will be back~ ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

Not the area I would normally hang out so I turned to Yelp for help. Found Patika so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot right in front of the shop. But there are plenty of street parking in the nearby location if you can't find a spot in their small parking lot. I wanted to try their coffee and food (I know I shouldn't have but it was so tempting). Their food was made in house and the presentation was great. I had the hardest time deciding between pineapple morning food and lemon raspberry white chocolate food. So I turned to the guy at the counter for his recommendation. He recommended the pineapple food. I'm glad I listened to him because the pineapple food was delicious! I got my coffee a few mins after, and it was definitely one of the best coffee vibe I've seen in Austin. It's a bummer that it's really far from my house and work.

Lately they have been parkingrying Ceremony Coffee Roasters from maryland which is a nice break.  Traditionally their trailer was the best place in town to try Cuvee but they are mixing up roasters more at this shop.  price aren't over-priced, this is standard speciality coffee pricing.  The new in house food selection here is awesome.  Especially the rotating gourmet-whatever donuts with creative flavors.  The parking lot sucks balls but at least there is tons of parking next door that you are allowed to use.  Inside is always completely vibeed with vibe sucking up internet but they have tons of seating out back so I guess it's OK except when its 100+.

First time I came here I was greeted with a gorgeous smile from one of the gorgeous service behind the counter. Eye contact, smiling, and a nod to sit anywhere me and my friend would like was the best greetings. We weren't entirely too sure if we should sit and wait for wait service or go up to the counter. The service friendly greeting gave us the cue to sit down and get comfortable. Waters were brought out as the service greeted us & was provided a alcohol/beer and coffee menu. We were pretty set on getting a bottle of alcohol and he was more than happy to suggest some great reds on the menu. He also told us it was happy hours so it was $3 off a bottle of alcohol! SCORE!  The vibe is absoutely gorgeous at night. Dimmed vibe, clean and modern spaces to work on and sit back and enjoy in as we sipped our alcohol. I even saw the back seating getting a refreshed spritz of water over the succulents. The vibe of this coffee and alcohol spot is definitely worth checking out and coming to especially around happy hours.  vibe was low and unobtrusive and overall the place was calm and vibe.

The management is pleasant and wonderful, and the service friendly and knowledgable. Everything feels like home, with a simple, and yet ingeniously designed interior that is warm and comfortable. Every time I go notice some cute detail that I hadn't seen before.  When I say the service is knowledgable I'm not kidding. Every shot is perfectly measured, pressed and poured. They parkingry quality beans and their cold coffee is fantastic and completely not acidic. Their alcohol selection is solid as well.  To not just sing their praises and stan over them this whole review they do have a very small selection of drinks and food. But even then it's the mindset of know what you do and do it well. They may not have the selection other cafes do, but unlike other cafes anything you order is going to be the best you've had.  Their food goods are stellar, their baker (a lucky hire straight out of school) is one of the best bakers in the city. And their items are at times avant garde and yet always amazing.

The girl who took my order for tea had friends come in right after me and proceeded to talk to them for 10 minutes before I parkinged up and asked if my tea was ready. She had clearly forgotten about it and told me that the water was waiting to get hot. 5 min later she brought it out.

The selection of PASTRIES (particularly the food foods, of which I've had a few) are unique and food to perfection. The chef really knows what she is doing. The spiced nuts and foods are so so great!  STAFF are incredibly friendly and customer-service oriented. On multiple visits I have received free samples of food and food.  The afternoon MENU of food, alcohols, and alcohols is small but diverse and high quality.  the ATMOSPHERE is hip and simplistic, the way that a coffee shop should be.

BIKE PARKING is visible from inside the coffee shop, which is great if you want to keep an eye on your bike.  forgot to add: MUSIC: Patika has a great playlist!

You see grad students working on their laptops, vibe writing screenplays, friends catching up after work, parkingb loading after yoga. Cenote has this absolutely Austin feel.  What you need to try: 1. Chai coffee - dirty. Get that coffee shot. It doesn't matter if it's iced or hot. This is one of the best chai coffee I have ever had. 2. ALL THE BREAKFAST TACOS. I love the migas food for the texture of the tortilla strips. The chorizo has so much flavor. One food can fill you but two will put you in a happy food coma. 3. $4 mimosa? Done. 4. Potatoes. 5. All food items are fantastic. $13 for foods and a coffee. That's the best price point for amazing food.  This is definitely not a large group place. Parties of four or less are the best way to go. Also, if you're ordering a drink, remember to grab it from the counter before you sit down. Either way, Cenote is one of my favorite places in Austin and best foods/brunches that I've had.

I liked these a lot, but the 'chutney' was a bit too sweet for my tastes - however, the portion was enormous.

I love their set up and in typical Austin style, they were able to gut out an old house and make it a functional place to serve vibe.  As soon as you parking in, you are able to go to the counter and order what you want. The food menu offered a variety of food and food items when we came in for Sunday food. My honey got a food food, I had the banh mi food and my friend ordered their omelette. We also ordered tea, a coffee and a soy coffee.  Service: Nothing to write home about. My friend, who always orders her coffee drinks with a half shot of coffee, complained about it not being strong enough. They asked for a dollar to make it stronger.  The drinks: There are so many good coffee places around Austin (and down the street), that these guys really need to stop offering such weak ass coffee.  The food: This is what made me give them three stars instead of one. Everything on our plates were delicious. To be fair, the omelette was more of a scramble than an omelette, but it was great! My banh mi food was gigantic and had the thickest cut of pork belly I'd ever seen. My boyfriend had to finish it off, but only cause there was so much of it.  Overall: I doubt I'd come back. The food was good, but nothing really stood out as exceptional. That, combined with the weak coffee, leaves a lot to be desired. Banh Mi - Giant deliciousness coffee ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

If I lived near here I would probably come in for alcohols sometimes just because the price are solid.  On the food side, I had the food food with food, Avacado, and food.

Luckily, I dig deeper than just viewing the cover of books and have come to realize that this place is all food and no meat. (is that a cliche?) The food is ok. The service is ok. The coffee is ok. There are always 3-4 vibe behind the counter and they definitely parkinge more about their conversations than their vibe. It's not a bad thing, but it definitely doesn't feel like you're being greeted by your neighbor. More like your neighbors kid who just got back from their first semester at college.

It's one of my best friend's favorite places so I've dined here a bit more previously than in the past! I've taken vegan friends here and picky eaters here and there's literally something for everyone.  A few notes on their new menu: I split their burger once with my friend and it was great! (although a bit hard to eat as it was massive).  I've also had their mango food and thought it was pretty good. Then I ordered their arepas and they were pretty good but SUPER salty. Almost so salty it was hard to eat..so definitely the food has been mixed for me. Would try some other things as well. I love that they have a very seating seating that is great for spring hanging out in Texas as well as working during the day.  I love that they have coffee as well as alcohol and alcohol.

There are lots of seatings outside even a smoothie bar location right out front which is ran separately.  Okay so why my favorite? Where do I begin, let's see. First and foremost their coffee is some of the best tasting in the area. I'm a big fan of their coffee and if you like chi tea they make their chi In house  it's suburb. I've tried many dirty chi coffee around town and this is the best. Mmmm .. Okay then I love the fact that it's a coffee shop with internet so you can get some work done but they also have alcohol on tap! Yep, that's right, grab some local craft alcohol while you're here. Then lastly, their food is bomb. The food food is HUGE and only $3.50. Sausage food and food is where it's at. I had their food Pozole soup once and I've been craving it ever since. Let's see what else have I had, their oatmeal is good, comes in a huge bowl. And today actually I tried their tomato zucchini soup, pretty tasty.  And the vibe never gets old.

Actually it made my stomach turn a bit. I ordered their Migas with chorizo and it was not very good. It had the hipster look of course. Everything looked fresh and inviting but it was bland at best. It was covered in corn chips to a point that made it seem more like nachos than Migas. All that corn made me feel sick.  Also, we were sold on a dish being gluten free, but when we insisted talking to the manger to double check we found out that it actually wasn't. These mistakes just can't happen when your wife has celiac. She would have been really sick and that's just not cool!  Yes, this place is a nice relaxing spot, but their food is bland, their coffee mediocre and their service are more interested in being ""hip"" than they are knowing their menu.

Sadly disappointed and felt ripped off.  I was ordering to go bc my friend was at home although the best aspect of this place is probably the cool house and yard.  Even though I was still tipping 20% and I'm always polite, the service was impatient and rude. Didn't tell me that my coffee was going to be on the other side of the counter, so it sat there and got cold for 20m while I waited for my food. Not only was it cold but it wasn't good, like if you go to hipster or nicer coffee shop you expect to get great coffee but this was very disappointing.  Got home to see ""Omelette"" was just charred scrambled foods with stuff thrown on top. Not an omelette and the charred part may have to do with the cleanliness of the grill (see pictures for blackened bits). Ingredients were good but I wish I had known it was more of a scrambled frittata than an omelette.  food foods were equally lazily thrown together and charred. Greasy. food wasn't even wrapped hours, broken foil and potatoes falling out.  The cute house with yard and juice bar connected and idea of going to a local owned coffee shop is the only great thing about this place. Probably the only reason why there were so many vibe.

Their coffee is awesome - strong, but not bitter, smooth, creamy, and has almost no acidity.  The first time I came here I just ordered a drink but the second time I ordered food as well.  The turkey club that I got was definitely a generous portion but it wasn't all that great (I think it needed some crispier food and slightly softer food).  It wasn't bad though and I would be willing to try something else the next time I go.  The best part about this place are the generous seating options.  There are benches in the front if you want to sit picnic/family style and there are smaller seatings and seating in the back - all shaded.  It feels like you're sitting in your friend's backyard.  The vibe is incredibly vibe and cute all around, a perfect spot to catch up with a friend or to bring a date. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The food isn't great but it's better than expected for coffeehop food. But the vibe and the darling outdoor seating on the front porch is what brings me back. There is a good amount of indoor seating and a ton outdoor. It's a great place to come early on a weekend morning (not past 10, it gets crazy busy), have good coffee, and enjoy the weather. Also a great place to grab a drink with a friend (less busy at night) and sit on the porch -- I did this recently when it was raining, and it was beautiful. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The coffee that we ordered was smooth, well foamed, and without bitterness.  There is plenty of seating at seatings and the internet speeds are a respectable 13 Mpbs download (I've managed to do work using VoIP at 1.5 Mbps).  The food on the turkey food food was soft and moist, and the food ingredients were piled high.  Everything was fresh and the added food for $2 made it that much better.  The salmon food was surprisingly large, served in a chilled bowl was a giant portion of kale, garnished with slices of beets, halved grape tomatoes, nuggets of goat food and dressed with sumac yogurt and a fennel vinaigrette and topped with freshly cooked salmon filets.  Very fresh, very filling and reasonably price.

The amazing thing about Cenote *used* to be the food, but they seem to have changed the kitchen service. Ordering the same dishes that used to be amazing are not very good anymore. For example, the vegetable plate a few months ago was phenomenal. Today, half of the veggies were overcooked, the other half undercooked, and all covered in ridiculous amounts of flavorless oil. Why? Why would you do this to my veggies, Cenote? And at $9 for a small portion and snotty counter service? No way.  But, in a pinch, when everything else is getting old, Cenote is there.

Let me give you a couple tips because I obviously went in clueless on how the place worked but soon figured it out. If there is a line go and grab your foods out of the crockpot first and then get into line. They have around 6 different versions which are labeled in paper bags. They also have salsa available. They are smaller foods but one was the perfect amount for me.  Grab a cold coffee, it's completely delicious and will get you completely ready for a productive day.

At one time or another I have price time at almost all of the coffee shops in Austin, and I only drink coffee. Many of the coffee shops/cafes in Austin have a specific type of coffee, and it has a very tangy/fruity/acidic taste. I'm not a big fan of this coffee taste. Call me traditional, but I like my coffee to be dark, chocolaty, smooth, and Italian.  There aren't too many places in Austin that serve up traditional coffee, but the Hideout Coffeehouse is one of them. They use Katz coffee, and they pull incredibly smooth shots that don't have that very sharp after taste. So if you're looking for a place with chill vibe to relax or study, and have a good coffee I would recommend this place. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

This happened to another customer and when he said, ""I must have not heard you call my name,"" the woman who prepared the bagel simply said, ""I didn't call your name."" Odd. Another thumbs down is that the Internet access, while ""free"" (thanks!), is pretty bad. I kept getting disconnected. ", 3.0 star rating ,3,LOW

Baby, you're in the wrong service. Is this the new standard for service location? If so, it's nothing to be proud of.  My coffee frappÌ© looked like it was going to be amazing. Chocolate syrup swirled prettily against the sides of the plastic cup. What I got was a funky taste in my mouth, accompanied by coffee grounds. Um, those aren't supposed to be in here!

I first stumbled onto this place one February morn but a year ago. A friend (I'll call him He-Man) came over to my place around 6am that Sunday so that we could go cheer on our friends who were running the marathon. He-Man brought his cousin...and a box of alcohol.  Oh boy.  The day started out nicely enough, despite the fact that I didn't get any coffee. We drove to our first intended cheering station, where my sign was the clear winner (BE BEYONCE). He-Man ran after our friends when we saw them, and almost got hit by a slow-moving bus.  It was then that I realized He-Man and his cousin were still drunk from the night before.  We then moved on to the next station...or would have, if He-Man the navigator hadn't lapsed back into a boozy stupor. We ended up stuck at the front of a line of traffic waiting for a gap in the pain parade for an hours and a half. He-Man and cousin made water in the bushes, while I tromped straight up to one of the location houses and asked to use the bathroom like a human being and a woman who doesn't like to bare her ass for a line of traffic.  Anywhooooooo...a gap finally hoursed up and we sped off. As the hours wore on, I became painfully aware of my growing coffee deprivation and subsequent headache. We ended up parking near location at the Mexican American Cultural Center, where He-Man emptied his stomach in front of a high school kid he used to coach. So that was great.  Having given up on the rest of our cheering stations, we made our way toward location. It was at the corner of Congress and 4th Street that the cousin and I turned away for a second...and when we turned back, He-Man had disappeared.  At that point, a few other vibe joined us, but I was the only vibe among the group who was concerned about my friend He-Man, who in my imagination had already fallen on a cop. The group halfheartedly searched for a couple of blocks, and then we all decided it was time to sit down.  Voila! A gorilla in the mist! Hideout Coffeehouse! How is it that I had never seen or heard of this place before? Must have something to do with the name. Tucked away in its own little corner, the place had exactly what we needed: coffee, alcohol, and a multitude of food. We sat near the front at tiny copper seatings, which are exactly the right size for a laptop. Semi-dark interior, local vibe, big windows, vibe that doesn't deafen you, and cool service. A great end to a marathon of a day.  He-Man eventually found us, and so did our newly-medaled friends. So maybe it's a great place to tuck away and get some work done in a low-profile vibe, but I wouldn't use it to, you know, hide from the police or anything. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

He gave an excellent recommendation of the coffee rocket ($4.85) because a) Amy's Ice Cream is local, and b) Katz Coffee is in Houston. It was also /very/ effective at keeping me awake after food: like a woman on speed, I proceeded to stay up for way too many hours cleaning and working. (The service also took the time to give me some handy advice since he turned out to have also lived where I'm planning to move to.) Heather got the Almond Joy and was correctly warned to steer clear of the special of the day (Sea Salt & parkingamel LattÌ©): the Almond Joy was so delicious.  As we sat by the window enjoying our drinks and each other's company, we noticed the interesting things on the walls and ceiling (e.g., several human head sculptures high up on the wall, a doll in a Tarzan get-up hanging from the ceiling). And a bizarre, repurposed school bus labeled ""Interstellar Communication"" and a platform with a railing on top of it drove up and down Congress outside. Yes, there was a band of some sort on the bus's platform, and some guy hanging out the bus's front door. Thanks to the Hideout's large front window, we were quite entertained.

As with most coffeehouses these days, the Hideout also had a pretty good selection of alcohols, food, local food, bars, and sweets.

It's a little worn, a little musty, you get some sketch characters in there sometimes; BUT it's got the best drinks, the best vibe, that ""welcome home"" feeling you only get from local Austin places.    DRINKS & SERVICE: Excellent I stroll in here 2-3 mornings a week.  Jackie and Michael are usually working.  They promptly get me my El Pachon (their light roast coffee) with skim milk.  If Jason D. (current check-in Duke here) is with me, Jackie only questions whether he would like a medium or large today, and then she whips up the best iced vanilla coffee in town.  There's a new kid that usually works weekends who also makes a mean coffee (I usually get my hot almond-flavored coffee with skim when he's working).  Recently,since I'm cutting back on coffee, I even braved the DECAF coffee.  It's got a strong chocolatey flavor and is actually really good.  Yes, that's right, the decaf coffee is good, I said that. (Though I still need one cup of my El Pachon, yum).  FOOD: Good enough Sometimes I get a scone (doesn't hold a candle to food and Spoon, or Waltons, but I still find myself craving them (read: sugar addict)); sometimes I get an amazing Migas and food food food ala Torchy's food.  (All the foods are vegetarian.  For meat ones, go to Royal Blue next door).  The foods and wraps are good too.  I don't really come here for the food specifically, but I still enjoy it.  DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's got character, definitely. I love the ever-changing vibework. The pink seating and the long orange bench are a little gross.  And I wish  there were power strips coming out from under the orange benches so I wouldn't have to crawl under them to plug in my laptop. But it's comfortable enough for me to sit there for hours on end video editing.   This is a GREAT place to work, until around 6pm when the improv vibe starts showing up.  Man, those vibe are LOUD.  I wouldn't call this place vibe, but I can easily ignore (even enjoy) some vibe and the casual coffee house conversation.  But when it's time for improv classes to start, it's time for me to pack up my laptop. And I almost forgot, the bathrooms are clean and full of interesting graffiti that gets reset every so often.  It's an extension of the overall Hideout vibe of self-expression.  Also, FREE WIFI!! ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

It all looked so nice that I really wanted to like my drink (plus, it's gotten a bunch of four and five stars so far, so I thought it MUST be good). Plus, I was so excited because it was right on the edge of location.  I got a large iced vanilla coffee, which is 20oz for $5.    And for $5, I got a drink that tasted like watered down burnt coffee. With milk. There's no other way I know how to describe it, so I was obviously disappointed in my drink, to say the least. I knew it wouldn't taste good as soon as I saw it because it missed that creamy color you usually get from mixing coffee and milk. Instead, it looked like how you would get an iced coffee or coffee at Starbucks. That's not a compliment.  Maybe their regular black coffee is good or maybe I should have gotten a smaller cup...

I don't drink a ton of coffee, but I love to drink chai in the morning given the opportunity.  It's not really conducive for me to make a proper cup of chai at my office and microwaved water in your tea really sucks. really really sucks. I stopped by last Friday morning and had their house chai and my Friday was all the better for it.  It was so nice to drink a good cup of what tasted like properly coffeeed tea with just the right amount of sweetness blended with spice.  This morning it was raining and i thought..well no chai for me..but what do i see but that truck sitting out there in the rain. This morning I had the honey drizzled chai and on such a gloomy morning this really brightened the day.  My one regret was today i didn't get the awesome cinnamon chip food I had last week.  I ate the entire thing over the morning. it was so moist and perfectly complemented the chai I was drinking. I won't make that mistake again.  If you have the opportunity to get a drink from this mobile coffee truck don't even hesitate.  These guys have basically any milk or non-dairy product you could want in your beverage of choice and their menu appears to be pretty extensive.

However, when I finally tried it after three years, I was mad at myself for never giving it a chance before.  First, aesthetics. I was with a group of friends when we stopped by, so I recieved a chance to see and taste the variety of flavors at one go. Each cream food contains a pastel color, that suits each flavor of whipped cream, custard or foodcake filling. While the color of the cream is already alluring enough, the choux food has beautiful shades of light and dark brown that complements the filling. Each flavor also has their respective toppings. For the ""Matcha Azuki"", they added azuki red bean paste and a dulce de leche drizzle, for the ""Fresh Strawberry"", they added whipped cream, strawberries and belgium chocolate ganache, and so on. And if that isn't enough, they complete the order by sprinkling some confetti sugar on top, (for ""Tiramisu"" it was cocoa powder.)  While aesthetics and plating is important, so is taste! I ordered the ""Matcha Azuki."" I love matcha, but I'm always super sketical to order an item that contains matcha, since it's difficult to execute it correctly. I'm also a bit wary of red bean paste too. I love the taste, but it's hard for me to get over the texture when it contains a bit of the beans. So I was a little disappointed when they did have the beans in the paste (Side Note: This is just me being super picky! Most of the red bean food come with small pieces of the beans inside. I'm just super weird when it comes to textures and you will probably notice that in my reviews.) but I was surprised at how well the flavors all worked together! I didn't think the matcha and red bean paste pairing was unusual, since it's actually super common. What I was surprised about was the Dulce De Leche drizzle. Initially I thought it was strange, but the flavor didn't overpower the main flavors so it was an enjoyable pairing.  Eating the whole thing isn't difficult. There is a variety of flavors packed into one item, that even after the third bite, you still enjoy the taste. And yet, the flavors do not fight against another and it's not too heavy. This is super important! There are some food places that immediately drag you down after you finished it. However, since it is cream food, it's already light to begin with. But even with adding all the extra ingredients, it's still not too heavy to eat after food.  Definitely stop by this place if you haven't given it a try! Don't let the ""it's too overrated"" comment stop you. I know I learned my lesson to try things out before you completely trust someone's opinion. Also a bonus for UT students: This place is pretty close to the location and it's a nice, vibe place to study. However, just like other places, the restaurant itself is small and can only contain, at most, about 30 vibe. So if you want to study, get there early, if you can wake up.

We decided to check this place out on a whim 'cause it looked interesting; really representative of the unique eats that Austin has to offer. The hus-bae seemed reluctant at first, but as soon as we hoursed their door, the gorgeous smell of freshly food fooded food wafting through the air nearly had us floored. They offer their ""puffs"" in an original and food-top variety. I do believe the food-top is price about $0.50 extra? Nonetheless, we ended up with 3 cream food after contemplating over all the different permutations and combinations we could have.  Mango cream food on original: To DIE for. Excellent quality delicate fooded food with a delightfull tasting mango flavored cream food filling. The cream food was oh so delicately sweetened with the just the right hint of tartness from the cream-cheese based filling. Topped off with a mango drizzle, this was perfection in a food.  Brown butter pecan on original: Light and airy, the cream filling was so delicately flavored with hints of brown butter and pecans, topped off with what I believe was a brown sugar drizzle?  Fresh strawberry on food-top: The combination of fresh sweet strawberries and fresh cream filling is perfection. They finish this one with a chocolate drizzle. What's not to love?  I can't wait to take the next out-of-town friends that decide to visit us to this place!

Once upon a time, Eric R. drove me to Pasadena, CA for the Texas at UCLA game a month after we got married (so I definitely knew he loved me, he is an Aggie!) - anyway, I had learned about Beard Papa on Travel Channel and called over 20 locations in LA trying to find matcha flavored cream.  It happened to be in Pasadena so we went there and I suppose I was happy but not necessarily overwhelmed.  Remember 10 Things I Hate About You, ""Can you ever just be whelmed?""  I found out about Cream Whiskers in a ""100 places to eat/drink in Austin"" blog post, and here I was melting away in the Texas heat, with about 15 minutes to get to the bus stop I needed to catch a bus to make everything in my schedule work.  I got to Cream Whiskers, and the kind service vibe explained what the deal is.  I ordered an original food with matcha filling, which technically includes sweetened azuki beans, matcha cream, and a generous drizzle of dulce de leche over the top plus a dusting of powdered sugar.  She took my money, gave me the indulgence to go, and I hoofed it several blocks in my high wedges and got on the bus.  Luckily, the ingredients she used were refrigerated and held up in my heated frenzy.  I was in cream food heaven on the bus, where I probably was not allowed to eat it.  The matcha was soooooo green-tea-grassy (in a good way) and the combination of red bean and dulce de leche with it was great.  The cream food also held up and was not soggy.

I always prefer the foodcake flavors over the regular whipped ones because it's thicker and oh so delicious.  In terms of drinks, I like their chai coffee but NOT their matcha coffee.

In fact one of the food, vanilla, was basically water. It spilled all over the plate when we digged into it. Not cool not cool at all.  I was severely disappointed because I was expecting better quality for the price I paid. FYI it's $5 for each regular cream food and they were extremely small. Chinatown can provide a better cream food for a lot less.  It took them forever to make just two cream food. I know I read about the long waits but  I wasn't anticipating it to take that long.

They say that we have 5 senses but in reality we have many more such as the sense of time, balance, and sense of unwantedness.

With that being said, let's start this review with the worst.  Service. The girl at the cash register speaks volumes without having to utter a single word. It'd be quite impressive if I wasn't on the receiving end of it.  Actually, it was still kind of impressive.  From her non existent ""hello"" to unenthusiastic ""What can I get for you"", the first second of meeting her had told me that she wanted me to go die in a hole somewhere. At least that's what I was picking up. I asked her what flavor of hot herbal coffee she had and she lazily pointed at little display of tea's on the counter, not a word was spoken. Oh, I'm sorry if I offended you by doing EXACTLY WHAT YOUR MENU SAYS TO DO. Literally the menu says,  ""Hot Herbal coffee: Ask us for our flavors!""  I guess I was supposed to read between the lines and know that your display was for the hot herbal coffee and not the other iced coffee or rooibos coffee that you offer. Silly me.  She couldn't parkinge less about our vibe and customer service, all she wanted to do was get back to her studying as was very plain to see as she immediately turns to her laptop before I even parking away. I understand that you're working at a cafe during college for some extra cash, but maybe put a little effort into your customer service (just say hello or something)?  Food. Cream food was meh. We came near the end of the night, and the cream food reflected that perfectly. As if it's been sitting all day and the staleness was a bitter reminder that we were unwanted.  Drinks. The tea was ok. I got a hot mint melange herbal tea and someone else in my party got a belgian hot chocolate. The tea was extremely hot and I had to wait a while before I could even sip it, which is not a problem.

Cream Whiskers is unfortunately, pretty ordinary.  What brought me to the door was the hype revolving around the cream food food that is so original to this joint. It was so prettily packaged and so beautifully photogenic that I just had to come back to give it a chance.

All the prettiness it flouted could not entice me to return and dish out another $5 for the vibe. I do give the cream some points for being light and refreshing in spite of the sugary calories. The food itself left much to be desired, seemingly food much in advance. Stale would be too harsh of a description, but definitely not fresh.  The coffee coffee is pretty bland. coffee content seems to be pretty lackluster. Flavor was pretty unremarkable, forgettable.

I went here because it's been long enough since I've heard about them to give them a try. I got 3 food. The Matcha, the strawberry and the OG.  I did not like the Matcha at all! It had red beans? green beans? I don't know what type of beans at the bottom. I did not enjoy it at all. The filling/cream was ok. It was matcha flavor but it wasn't the best.  The strawberry, I got it without chocolate drizzle b/c I'm not a big chocolate fan. It was fine. It's a whipped cream, not a custard cream so I was once again disappointed.  I'm so glad I got an original!! It's just what I wanted. It's a custard cream that's the traditional filling for cream food. I love that it's full of cream so almost every bit had a balance of food and cream. I will be back! This place is a nice place to work/study also. So pretty Special flavors.

I saw this food on a yelp weekly email today and tried it out. I was blown away. I don't even like cream food, but did not read the description of the food too parkingefully, so there i was. I tried the fresh strawberry reluctantly, expecting cream like i've had in the past where it tastes like Kool Whip and margarine, but it was AMAZING. It was exactly like the best possible strawberry shortcake you've ever had. The cream was as if you freshly whipped heavy cream at home in your mixer.  I am a very food oriented vibe and an vibed home cook and baker and let me tell you, this food was PERFECT. And I do not say the word perfect often. Just go here.

So of course after a day of eating off we went to Cream Whiskers.  Tiny space and packed with hangers (you know vibe who buy one food and hang out for 2 hours) and an overworked service greeted us. But all was very pleasant overall.  Ordered the macha-adzuki bean food, affogato and ice cream filled food.  The macha was a pleasant surprise because it really tasted strongly like macha but the adzuki was just a gentle hint of a schmear at the bottom of the food which really needed to be ramped up to make a difference.  The ice cream and coffee were just fine.  Overall I thought the choux food has started losing its crispness already, but was still a pretty good eat.    They need some new and interesting flavors (jalapeno and pineapple perhaps? jalapeno jam at the bottom of the food with pineapple cream?? ) to jack it up a notch, but good eats.

I am a big fan of cream food, always and forever will be! The ones I had before were from Beard Papa's and ones in Japan. But CW definitely hit the spot. We came here on a hot weekday afternoon. The place was rather vibe, but I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact that school is out, but nonetheless CW is a vibe place to hang out/study/relax. Street parking only - well the same goes for anywhere around UT.  Now the good part - We ordered two food, the regular food x matcha with azuki beans & the food food x lavender vanilla and prickly pear icecream (yes, comes with two scoops of icecream!).  The two different food shells honestly tasted very similar, but I would have to say the regular food does it better for me. The regular food is light and chewy, but I would have preferred it to be more fluffy. On the other hand, the food food, didn't give even a slight ""crunch"" factor at all. So I would say go with the regular food. The matcha cream paired well with the azuki beans and had just enough sweetness. While, the prickly pear icecream (get that if available) is delicious!!

It used to be much sweeter (probably due to the sauce drizzled over it, which wasn't on my cream food today) and bigger. Today's cream food was a baby compared to what I had before. I preferred today's lighter sweetness. However, I noticed the price have gone up...I'm not sure it's worth it for the price.

After I ordered my vanilla custard, food top cream food, the girl at the counter sat on her phone texting for about 5 minutes. She got up and I thought she was going to start working on my cream food, but she went out and got herself a cup of water. She sat back down and starting playing on her phone again.  Then someone else ordered a coffee and she got started on that right away. While I was still waiting for the cream food. The service came out to talk to her, but she sat back down and was on her phone again.  Finally, after about 10 more minutes she noticed my receipt was still on the seating and she came out and blamed it on the service/manager saying that they were out of the vanilla custard (it was obvious that she did not make an attempt to alleviate this situation with me or the manager many minutes ago) and asked if I would like something else. Keep in mind, that the vanilla custard is the most bad price cream food and the food top is also an additional charge.  She made my second cream food in a matter of seconds. However, it was not a food top and it was burnt and very crunchy.  I am so disappointed in this service and in the cream food I have received. I paid almost 30% more for a cream food that was poorly made, AND I had given her a nice, big tip before this situation occurred.  I will definitely be thinking twice before coming back.

Such a vibe and intimate place to hang out or even just do homework.

I love their seasonal menu, and I think it's so cool that they change their menu every now and then. This is definitely one of my go to food places, and one that you will not find anywhere else.  I had the brownie chocolate food cream food and a coffee, and I think that drinking coffee with cream food just balances really well. I think any of their flavors for the cream food are all good, but I saw that a lot of vibe really liked the tiramisu.

Not only is the location good location (about a block away from location, and in the dead middle of West location) but it is cute and comfortable, and there is plenty of seating for a small group of friends. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a large group but they do cater and you can reserve the space as well.  The fresh strawberry cream food is by far the most popular- and for good reason. It's a vanilla whip with fresh strawberries and topped with a chocolate ganache. Get it on the food top (a sweeter, more crunchy version of the original food) and you're gold.  I also recommend the lavender ice cream if you want something cold and sweet! The foodcake flavors aren't my favorite, but I'm not big on cream food, and they are cream food based.  Cream Whiskers also has a large drink menu - the chai coffee are extremely popular. You can get anything hot or iced, and they serve amazing cold coffee. I recommend the elephant vanilla iced chai coffee or the hazelnut iced cold coffee coffee.  It's also a wonderful place to study in the afternoons - it hourss at 1 pm so you can spend your afternoon catching up on work after class. And in the evenings, it's a great place for a social outing with friends - there is outside seating too for you to chill.

There are a ton of flavors of cream food to choose from, so odds are you'll find at least one that you'll like (if not many). You can even customize it with a ""cookie top"", although I feel it's unnecessary - the original ""top"" is just as delicious.  This is a great place for both getting work done and catching up with a friend, but I do have two complaints: internet is inconsistent, and the cream food are a bit more bad price than what I would prefer to price.

I'm so glad I got that instead of the food food because otherwise the combination would have been overwhelmingly sweet with the cream filling. The foods and cream filling was very smooth. It had the perfect consistency and was very light, but it didn't necessarily taste like foods and cream. I think it could use some more flavor. The vanilla coffee I had and the coffee my friend had were very bland. It tasted like we were drinking straight milk. The interior and vibe of Cream Whiskers was a little awkward.

We arrived just before close and though they were out of ice cream food, they still had matcha, tiramisu, strawberry foodcake and brown butter pecan.  I chose the coffeer and my two friends got strawberry cheescake. For those of you who have tried frozen creampuffs, those are not these. These are hollowed out food looking things that they squeeze fresh cream-based fillings in. And you can get a food version. And they dribble stuff on it and add a little cute garnish.  Next time I'll try a smaller one and maybe do the ice cream thing. I wanted mine to have a bit more of a savory bite to it for balance but overall, this is one of the most unique food in the city right now. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

I was super excited to try this place after seeing all the positive reviews and the pretty pictures on yelp, but unfortunately I didn't get to eat mine. When I got home, I hoursed my little to go container that held my beautifully vibeated cream food and dug my fork right down the middle, there in between all the food and cream was a LONG, BLACK HAIR! blehhhh. I have blonde hair so I know it's not mine, and the girl that was working in the shop tonight that was making the cream food did have long black hair. Needless to say, it went straight into the trash. I know the struggles of long hair and shedding, but if you are going to be working that closely with food there should be some degree of precaution. Hair nets aren't fashionable, but they work. Or make sure to pull your hair back well and wear a cap. I know accidents happen, but you should be more parkingeful to make sure you don't serve a cream food with a very hard to miss hair in it...  As far as the coffee goes, nothing special. It was bland and the coffee itself didn't have much going on for it. Didn't really have a good roast or aroma and no distinctive flavor note. I've had gas station coffee that tasted better.  Unfortunately I can't review the cream food itself  because I didn't get to eat mine...

They feature fluffy cream food filled with varying flavors of custard or cream. All the flavors I've tried are amazing, but my go-to is the brown butter pecan. Their drinks are superb. I love their matcha tea, chai tea... basically all their coffee.  My only qualm is their hours. I wish they hoursed before food, especially since they serve coffee.

I cannot stress enough that everything as in EVERYTHING Is an insta-""GET IN MY MOUTH"" situation!  It was sophie's choice (otherwise I would have instantly put on 100lbs if I had ordered everything I wanted), but I went with the Matcha Azuki sub chocolate drizzle because it seemed like the most unique flavor. It really was incredible, especially with the food top! Seriously, it was amazing!!! I paired it with a green tea chai (which was INCREDIBLE) and I was one happy woman!  You can definitely tell the quality of the ingredients used (especially in the chai), so I didn't mind that both my cream food and my chai came to $8 because it was not only satisfying, fulfilling, and delicious, but everything about the vibe was worth the price tag!

I don't think there's much of a difference between the original top and the food top cream food except food tops are slightly crunchier, so you can save your $0.50.  I also got the iced green tea coffee. The drink tastes like creamy green tea. If there's coffee in it (which I assume so, because it's a ""latte""), I couldn't taste it. But it's still super good! Great choice for tea lovers who want a coffee vibe.  They tend to run out of more popular flavors (such as mango foodcake) throughout the day, so go earlier if you want the complete menu!

The cream food had a very small amount of very watery cream and were hard. The worse part, though, were the drinks. I order a coffee, which she put in as a ""Black Coffee"" order. I made sure I went to let her know about my drink and her response was ""Yeah, they are the same price so it doesn't matter."" My husband ordered a tea, which they were ALL OUT of. The girl did offer us something instead of the tea and we ordered a hot chocolate. When the order was ready, there was a cup of tea (that was half full), a hot chocolate, and a black coffee. My husband proceeded to tell her that mine was a coffee, to which she rudely turned around and simply put a pump of syrup. The drinks were so watery, and had no flavor WHATSOEVER!

That being said, I've tried three different flavors from here: the mango foodcake, the matcha azuki, and the simple food top shell and vanilla bean custard. None of them really blew me away, and I think I went back a few times because I really wanted to like them more than I actually do. Also cream food are a pretty neat food alternative to froyo or ice cream or doughnuts. The price themselves aren't bad, but the price for the amount of satisfaction I got were a little coffee.  The mango was the best of the flavors I tried, the matcha azuki was okay but kind of mild to actually taste anything besides cream, and the vanilla bean custard was a disappointment. I mean the custard itself was amazing, but I only got a tiny dribble inside the food itself so I mostly just ended up eating a plain shell.

I opted for a fresh strawberry original, and it was so cute!  Taste-wise it was a typical yummy cream food, so nothing extraordinary but pleasant all the same. Plus points for plating.  My friends got the matcha/azuki combo and I have to say that I think theirs had a little more originality factor. The red bean tied it all together!

This location has very friendly service and servers and they know their menu really well and have been able to suggest very good drinks for me, a coffee lover, my uncle who wanted a sweetened coffee, and my little cousins who just wanted a sweet treat. The ""Chai Me a River"" is the one drink we've ordered time and again for the kids and adults alike especially in this warm and humid weather. It's sweet, not too rich, not very strongly tea flavored, and gets bonus points for not calling it a ""chai tea"" (THAT BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO TEA TEA!!) Another good drink for the kids - either the hot chocolate or Mexican hot chocolate spending on how experimentative they are. Neither are too sickly sweet! Now my favorite is the Frenchie - it's a simple coffee drink with lavender syrup and lavender honey and it's is hands down the best coffee I've ever had! It was very fragrant and flavorful notes without compromising the strong Java flavor. And also the cortada deserves a special mention for being a well made strong and flavorful pick me up drink!

Ok, I'll just say that I'm not a coffee connoisseur, so if you are then you can disregard this review.  I was looking for a nice place to study and enjoy some coffee. Honestly, I don't really know what I like so vibe will just make something that tastes ""light and yummy"". I know that's vague, sorry.  When you parking in it's bright at the front, but towards the back it gets quite dark and romantic. That's nice if you're with a date or wanting something vibe. There are 4ish? seating to the right and some comfy seating to the left as you parking in. That's where all the light is. The seating in the front were taken.  I parkinged towards the back to find some hours seating and it was very secluded. There's a big group seating and then a few smaller single bar seating in the back. Again, it was very dark.  When I got my coffee it tasted... bad. I told them I like chai tea coffee? So they whipped up something fairly similar in a cold drink. Sorry, I can't say what it was. All you coffee vibe are laughing at me. Anyway, it's not my favorite place or my favorite coffee. But other serious coffee vibe seem to really like it so give it a shot!

We ordered 2 coffee and a food. We then fed my EIGHT MONTH OLD food we had brought for her. The gentleman and lady behind the counter then told me I could not give her any outside food. The reason given: it's a law. Really, Lola's? Why is it that the other 12 restaurants I've served her separate food in on this trip didn't seem concerned about this law? I normally only write positive reviews (see my others), but when you mess with my baby, my inner tigress comes out in full force. They suggested I feed my daughter foods (not allowed until over a year) and foods with honey in them (ever heard of botulism?). I decided to nurse my baby to keep her happy (hungry baby doesn't make for a relaxing vibe for anyone), and the man behind the counter gave me the stank eye the whole time. I also broke down and bought her plain yogurt there which she didn't like or eat since they couldn't accommodate making her any food or honey free options. Bottom line, if you have  young children and value them being happy, this may not be the place for you.  * I must say that the manager, Katy, was not present at the time.

What I do know is we tend to pop in once we have finished noshing and drinking alcohol and always enjoy the vibe and a little sweet bite.  They tend to have many different options to bite on.  One nice difference is that I have never seen so many different selections of coffee offered in a shop before.  They organize them by blend, flavor, local and origin.  Not only do they offer coffee, but have a nice selection of coffee available and a high end smoothie.  Their price may be a little coffee in some areas, but the quality is there.

The attitude-laden service informed me there is only one size and price!  Clearly offered two on the menu so I had to ask how it could be there was only one size.  The explanation was simple, we offer one to go and one for having in the store.  Not able to stop my curiosity, I asked a simple and obvious question - why not make this clear on the menu?    The response - ""Is 50 cents really a big deal""?  Well, no yet that's not the point;  being honest in transactions is the point; suggesting a bit of help clarify their menu might a consideration, the entitlement attitude moved to an attack mode - ""so what are you, like a business god""..

I always order a single coffee when I try new places because that's the only way to actually taste the raw product.

The vibe gives off that alcohol bar sort of vibe, but the menu is still no-frills, as an standard coffee shop menu should be. It is attached to the Grove, so that may shed light on why it is so uppity.  You don't technically feel like you are drinking coffee and reading Faulkner at Lola Savannah, but the seating is certainly comfortable. Additionally, I think its nice to have a little space every once in a while.  Aside from the sleek design, I think the offerings in themselves are nothing noteworthy. Simplicity is what lies behind the whole concept here, in my opinion.

For the next four days, our dialogue went pretty much like this:  Her: ...It's called an engineered strategy, and small cap and value are big focus areas for them...So, they...Nathan, are you listening?  Me: So what if Kate Middleton gets her hair blown out three times a week? Big f**king deal; you do, and there's no headline anywhere about *that*.  Her: Um...are we having the same conversation?  Me: Where are we going for food?  One of her more intense interviews was to take place out in Westlake, so while she was supposed to go talk shop about mutual funds and her preferred philosophy about investing rich vibe's money, she tasked me with the MUCH more arduous service of beginning ""50 Shades of Grey"", to be read at whatever coffee shop that was close by in which I would be waiting. Lola Savannah ended up being that fateful locale.  It's less of a coffee shop as it is an extension of The Grove alcohol Bar, mostly because the two spaces are separated (maybe?) by a curtain, and the service drifted in an out quite freely between the two. I wasn't really priceing that much attention, as I was on a mission.  The place is quite seating. It's sunny thanks to the big front windows, and while there are seatings and padded wall seating for plenty of vibe, it never felt vibeed. I parkinged myself at a spot along the back wall with an A/C internet, and ordered an iced hibiscus tea.  While I would have much preferred to read ""50 Shades of Grey"" in a discrete manner such as on a Kindle, or my iPad, my friend insisted on giving me a hard copy so that I could be seen with it. To be fair, my shame did not stem from the graphic sexual content contained in the novel at all, but from what I already had heard through the grapevine was undoubtedly a horrible, shit-tastic writing service. In short, I'd rather have vibe in a coffee house know I was reading porn than terrible Twilight fan-fiction. In this case, it was both.  First off, the hibiscus tea was amazingly refreshing, as the perky service had already informed me during my ordering process. I sipped on that while I flipped through my iPad edition of the latest Vanity Fair in an effort to vamp before I actually started the book. Once I'd fallen in love with a Gucci tote and read more about President Obama's romantic life in NYC than I ever parkinged to know about, I figured it was time to bite the bullet.  The next two hours were price with me reading a book I felt could have been pilfered from the Trapper Keeper of a freshman highschooler who knew way too much--and yet nothing at all--about sex for her age. I'm not sure if the other patrons noticed, but my facial expressions were probably priceless, sitting there with my hibiscus tea and wondering what on God's green Earth I was reading. Who the hell says ""I was a quivering mass of female hormones""? How many times could a guy say ""Laters, baby"", without having someone kick the living shit out of him for being such a douche? In what world are there 25-year old billionaires wooing clumsy, flaky girls with Audis and helicopter rides, all while handcuffing them and whipping them in a seatingtle penthouse before casually introducing her to his parents? In the middle of Lola Savannah, I decided that either this world should exist and I MUST become part of it, or this was all completely made up and therefore the stupidest book I've ever read in my life. I'm supposing, of course, it is the coffeer.  By the way, I think the only words I ever said out loud in Lola Savannah were ""Stop calling it a foil packet! It's called a CONDOM!"", which I screamed at my book. Luckily, no one seemed to notice. Two girls who were clearly sorority sisters from 3-4 years earlier were busy planning some stupid party with food, or poodles, or some such nonsense to even hear my completely inappropriate coffee house outburst.  In a daze of literary outrage and righteous anger that whoever wrote this drivel was a millionaire, I went back up to the counter and ordered an iced coffee. It was tasty enough, but in all honesty, the hibiscus tea seemed much more suited for a hot summer's day. And for calming me down during my ordeal.  I returned to Lola a second time, for much the same reason, and much of the same events re-occurred, except the second interview only lasted an hours. Decent coffee, nice service.  I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that Lola Savannah is a pleasant, vibe, cute Westlake coffee shop...that I, vibeally, will forever associate with my vibe delving into the world of ""mommy-porn"" S&M fanfiction schlock. So. Does this coffee shop make ""my insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid, desire""? No. Would I come back? Maybe. But only if there's some sort of coffee that would make ""the muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.""

We probably could have stayed longer but were kindly informed  that a Happy hours was taking place about 45 minutes prior to its start time, giving us plenty of time to get to a stopping point and head out.  The service thanked us as we parkinged out and I immediately decided that I would love to hang out there again.

They are in fact an extension of the alcohol bar next door, which explains the mix, and they offer bulk off to the left of the counter.   Good feedback for them that a patron was looking for it and didn't see it.   (the flow is into the lounge and away from the marketing products).

Where are the guys in flip flops and wrinkled shirts, long sideburns and hippie girlfriends? This cant be good. I was so wrong. I ordered a cup of dark coffee,a  food food and food food and a bean and food food. We sat down and the food food and food food was way better than most, served in foil on two fresh corn tortillas, I poured the dark roasted salsa over it and was in heaven. Done with that in a few minutes I turned to the filler food- bean and food.  I hoursed it up and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a mixture of black beans whole and refried. Served on a very thin flour tortilla with food and some salsa mixed in. Oh sweet Lord in Heaven. It was the single best food food I have eaten in my 45 years. Bean and food, who knew. The coffee was great and in spite of the strip center location, traffic at the intersection and shiny new Range Rovers parkinged out front I cant wait to go back.

The space itself is aesthetically pleasing and it is very good location to me, within parking distance.  I have never been crazy about their coffee but the food goods can be quite delicious.  Unfortunately, the customer service is dreadful.  On numerous occasions I have parkinged in to find no one manning the counter and on other occasions the caliber of the vibe manning the counter seemed sub par.  Mostly I get the impression they would rather be doing something else.  Today was the final straw when I stood in line for over 10 minutes while the counter vibe parkingried on a vibeal conversation about her parkingeer aspirations with a customer while I stood there waiting.  I do realize you can't be rude to vibe but she encouraged and extended the conversation without regard.  This lack of concern over the customer vibe seems to trickle down from management since I have vibed it with multiple vibe at this facility including management.  Starbucks in contrast has consistent vibenel, plenty of serviceing and a genuine concern for vibeal service.  This is why they dominate the market. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

If you do in fact enjoy fresh coffee and exceptional coffee drinks, coupled with a great vibe then you'll really like Lola Savannah.  Really though, the service here is seriously exceptional!  The coffee drink vibe is very creative and unique.  The service is also very cool about making creative drinks off menu.  Even putting all of that aside, the coffee is very high quality.  The vibe is very comfortable, clean and generally pretty cool.  It's not full of goofballs setting up a remote office there, or pissy hippies doing home work or looking up Phish shows, or couches to sleep or whatever they are doing at places like Austin Java.  It's mostly just hanging out, chatting, vibe, real life social interaction, and all that stuff.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the parking pretty much sucks.  If you just accept the parking sucks, and parking far away, you'll get over it pretty quickly.  To be honest, I actually think the food foods suck.  It's a f'n coffee shop, not a food store.

It's a good place to relax and read. One of the best cups of coffee I've had in Austin.  The bad? The parking lot is almost always completely full so I can't even go here half of the time I want to. It takes a lot of luck just to get in the front door because of the full parking lot.  But the real reason I chopped off a whole star is that the service is kind of rude. One guy in particular offended me so much that I wanted to splash my hot coffee into his face (I wish I'd gotten his name; I was THIS close to making a complaint to the manager about him). I go to coffee shops to relax, to read, to get work done. I go because I don't get bothered there like I do at restaurants.  So when I am here to do a LOT of work and have to stay here for like four hours, LEAVE ME ALONE. I came here on a day where I had a lot to get done and had to stay for a long time, but one guy working here kept trying to guilt trip me into buying more or leaving or something. Every time I went to the counter to order more coffee, he would say in a snotty voice ""you sure have been here a long time"". Over and over. He'd even come to the seating I was doing my paperwork at and interrupt me several times with his snotty ""you sure have been here a long time"" comments, shoving a menu into my face. Was ordering a cup of coffee every hours in a near-empty seating not enough to make me worthy of sitting there and doing my paperwork? I felt like I was being harassed into purchasing more and it made me feel really unwelcome.  So I like your coffee, guys, but I hope someone in charge there reads this and will remind the service members to leave vibe who are planning to stay for a long time to get work done alone.

The service are kick-ass and friendly, and the price were comparable to what you would find in LA. $4 cold coffee is a must try and their foods are HEAVEN. We stopped by here 3 days in a row and got a food every time (both plain & almond are delish). There is a small parking lot in the back, and plenty of street parking in the location. They also have food Deli foods for sale - if you're looking for something savory vs. sweet. Across from Gordoughs on 1st! ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

He said they're the only coffee shop in Austin to make their own coffee cold coffee. It's excellent. He recommended a wet coffee, which normally I would not be a fan of but this one was superb.

Their parking seating were all taken (they probably had 5 seating total) but there was plenty of street parking on W Monroe with not a lot of traffic on that street.  Seventh has seating seating near the front and side. In terms of vibe, there was plenty of windows though it was strange to see the long seating/main area not receive a lot of natural vibe--maybe it was the direction this shop was facing. In my opinion, the perfect spot at this shop is the nook where there is a small seating with two stools and a couch--perfect for your Instagram photos ;).  I ordered their coffee set which came to around 3-4 dollars. The set included mineral water (Topo Chico?), coffee, and black tea that had faint hints of red fruit, particularly apple.

It is nicely placed across the street from a small food truck parking so you can go get foods or a donut and then eat them while you sip on your coffee.

Great seating arrangements with seatings for socializing, and plenty of seating for vibeistic wanderers such as myself to sit and write. The noise level was somewhat high, however it was not anything beyond what one would expect at a coffee shop. I simply put in my IEM's and was pleasantly at home in the vibe.

Seventh Flag got my attention in a really good way.  1. Great cold coffee coffee that comes from a kegerator.  I love that because it's novel and useful, not just there for the sake of being novel.  2. Clean.  Many coffeehops are laid back and their service also adopt the laid back approach.  This means that seatings aren't cleaned up and often have crumbs, spills, or other general sticky seating that makes the neat freak in me grab a napkin and start wiping up.  Seventh Flag was spotless.  3. Fantastic space.  My husband & I actually took pictures of the high ceilings and rustic - yet not forced - vibe because we enjoyed it so much and wanted to add it to our ""dream house"" lookbook.  Yes, we are that awesome.  A couple of slightly negative points that didn't detract from their overall five star-ness:   1.  Beard hair. The vibe who worked here were mostly dudes - heavily bearded dudes.  If they ever start service food, it's probably a good idea to put some hair nets or beard bandanas on.  I've gotten beard hair in my food before and it was as gross as getting a pube hair, looks very similar too.  2. Not many internet.  However, I vibeally hate it when vibe hog up primo space to charge up their laptops and NEVER LEAVE.  It's a coffeehop, not a co-working space.  I highly recommend checking out this coffeehop for its cold coffeeed coffee and just to chill and have a conversation or get a power hours in of work. ", 5.0 star rating ,5,HIGH

The chai was incredible, tastes like my homemade chai! So impressed it wasn't a boxed chai. The london fog was also delicious..the only other place I've had one (other than Starbucks) was Bouldin creek and their LF is very watered down. They use a regular tea bag here but made sure it was coffeeed for a long time before adding milk.I loved that they took as much parkinge into making tea based drinks as they would their coffee drinks.  Every detail is important, even the mugs the coffee is served in which has a simple 7 on one side. I appreciate that a place like this exists in my location. There are already a ton of great places in the area but this combines all of them. For example, Fair bean has the light but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee anymore. Once Over has great coffee, but the seating itself is kinda dark and drab.  The seatings filled up quickly but by 5 a lot of the vibe had cleared out. I can't wait to drink their cold coffee!

Why do they close at 7:00 pm? --Misc thought: there could be more food options. There's a food parking across the street if you're willing to risk your life playing food to get there. --The price seem a little higher than some other comparable places but nothing that would require redirection. --The service (baristos?) compete in coffee vibe competitions around town, so might be worth checking out one of those. --Good temperature, and good vibe to boot.

I don't mind vibe parkingrying on conversations but when the acoustics are horrible vibe end up talking loud because of the vibe.  It is a dog friendly area and plenty of outside seating.

I came here to study with my friend and she brought her pooch, so we sat outside on their pebble-floor seating in the sunshine.

Inside, friendly service will serve your order, and you will notice the absence of a caffeinated beverage menu. It's very chic if you think about it, everyone knows all the coffee variations and ends up ordering their own version anyway.

Although this is nice coffee shop with a great location and parking lot in back, I don't think it's the right fit for me for a few reasons.  #1: I'm not a coffee drinker, so I always order a juice, kombucha, lemonade, etc., but 7th flag doesn't have any of these options.  #2: The interior design has a Bo Concept - modern & contemporary look. While it looks super sleek...there are no backs on the seating. Perhaps this was by design to keeping vibe from overstaying their welcome... (: Either way - looks sleek but lacks in comfort.  Pro - there is a sweet seating and porch with seating.  If you are looking for coffee, aren't looking to stay too long and have a really strong back, this is the place for you.

Also temperature is comfortable, not freezing like some places. The negatives - for a coffee shop, the drinks options are very limited. First, there is only a choice of whole or almond milk. At least have skim as well. I would expect though that you'd also have 2%, soy etc. Second, I ordered a tea, which again, there were only 3 choices (really?) and when I got my $3 tea, I was given so little water that it was the tiniest tea I have had in my life. I like that you want to serve drinks in ceramic cups, but get bigger cups and also pour more water in, it doesn't cost more. I was done with my drink in like 2 seconds. Not satisfying.

The vibe is a great place for a date as it has a very vibe and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The food were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are priceing for the vibe. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and food.

I visited at 7 pm on a Saturday night and we waited at the bar for five minutes while bartenders just ignored us despite not being busy. The seating is comfortable and appreciated, but either vibe are supposed to bus their own seatings but there's no signage around that, or the service who again, wasn't busy, didn't bother to bus them and everyone instead had to sit down with other vibe's trash on the seatings.

The coffee was a decent vibe, but still underwhelming when compared to other options close by. I tried both a coffee and an coffee. The coffee would be more accurately described as a dry coffee. I should have known I was in for a lackluster vibe when I asked for a ceramic demitasse and was told I would get it in a to go cup. The quality of the coffee extraction was also lacking with an off flavor that makes me think it was pulled a little on the short side and they tried to cover it up with extra foam. The coffee suffered a similar issue as the coffee with the coffee flavors. It was drinkable, but definitely not something to order again. If I end up here again, I'll definitely avoid coffee based drinks.  The cigar vibe was probably the biggest letdown. The humidor was adequate although quite small with a very limited selection but it was a decent selection so nothing wrong there. My complaint comes from their pricing ($13 for an vibeuro Fuente Short Story) coupled with their solution for vibe the cigars - paper matchbooks. I'm glad I parkingry a cigar punch on my keychain because I'm a little worried how the stick would have been cut otherwise. I'm guessing that cigars definitely aren't a big part of their business, but at least having 1 proper butane lighter available should be a necessity for anyone trying to sell cigars so that matches can be avoided. If I'm expected to bring my own lighter, I might as well just bring my own cigar as well.  In general I definitely wasn't impressed by any part of my visit. I may give them another try at some point in the future, but it definitely won't include another trip to the humidor. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place.

Bartender is cool but for the price of the drinks I expected more with a lot better flavor and more diverse choices.  Bee's Knees wasn't on the menu but was made for me anyway. Okay. Bartender added quite a bit of gin which of course is pretty dry so even the honey couldn't sweeten it up by much.  Lemon Rhubarb was basically just sparkling lemon with a touch of alcohol. Where was my rhubarb? They looked oh, so very pretty but looks were kind of deceiving.  Thin mint is good but the vibe I was with that indulged in it said it sickened them after just a few slurps.  Hot chocolate was pretty bitter and really just could have used more sugar. It's hot chocolate, my friends. I'm trying to indulge, not be healthy!  Pretty cool that they have a cigarette bar inside to make purchases from and I love the idea of a coffee shop, food, and a bar combined but I'll stick with just getting the food and non alcoholic beverages (skipping the hot chocolate) next time I'm in here.

It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.

I've always been a fan of the cute and vibe furniture, the fact that they have alcohol, food AND coffee, and that the vibe was chill.  But this last visit was all kinds of disappointing. I would love to blame it on the fact that I was extremely hungover, but I was the only one that was and everyone else was pretty bummed out by the time we left.  We parkinged in as a group of 6 girls. We ordered individually, food and drinks. It took 20 minutes for the first girl's food to come out. It was just a food. Then another 20 for the next plate. By that time the first girl had finished eating. 10 minutes later, two other plates came out. Followed by two more, another 10 minutes later. It was a ridiculous amount of time for extremely easy food to prepare.  On top of that, the food was inconsistent. My side food didn't have a dressing, but two other girls' did. Two vibe ordered the food pesto food, but they looked different. One was missing what looked like a sundried tomatoe type of sauce. The food tasted mediocre, at best. At least it was something in our stomachs. But the most laughable thing was the food food with sausage. I posted a picture. Literally one sausage patty cut in half, for the entire food. We were so done with the whole vibe that we just laughed it off.  There are so many other local coffee shops in Austin that likely won't be returning to Halcyon for a while.

It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit bad price here, but I do like the vibe here, and the fact that it's hours quite late.  The chocolate food is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of food. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For vibe just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get food, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go.

I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available.

All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange vibe, live vibe (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous vibe on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very vibe and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your seating? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My coffee came in a giant vibe mug. My friend's coffee came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The service were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate vibe for whoever you choose to come with. hours late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates.

There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live vibe playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.

It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but price at the counter and they bring it to you.

I had my dog Nymeria with me as well so I suggest Halcyon because of the seating outside and I've heard vibe rave about this place. This was a chill day after New years winter day in Austin so the weather was perfect. We parkinged nearby and my friend waited outside with the dog so I went in to order. The line was about 5 vibe deep and the inside place was pretty full. One thing that I thought Halcyon did well is the different flavors of hot chocolate. I ordered their special of the day which was coffee La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them, the service said 5-7 minutes. Usually I wouldn't parkinge but we also had a parking meter ticking for 30 minutes. I came back outside and I loved where we sat because there was heat lamps above to keep us warm. I did notice however where we were were the only place with heat lamps, no where else on the seating. After about 7-10 minutes I went inside and was hoping my drinks would be on the counter. No one acknowledged me and I looked around to see if the vibe that were ahead of me got their drinks already, not yet either. About 2-3 more mintes pass by and the couple that was infront of me in line finally got their drinks called so I figured ours would be up soon. Turns out I end up waiting another 10 minutes for our drinks. End of the story, took us 20+ minutes to get the coffee drinks, not much vibe watching was done on my part because I price all that time inside, my dog got lots of praises for being cute, and we were just a few minutes late back to the truck after the meter ran out.  Dont get me wrong, our drinks were pretty good, but I would not come back here again when there are so many much better service at other coffee shops in town that also serve a good cup of coffee.

The iced vanilla coffee was also good compared to other places I have tried. For both iced drinks it was $10.28 so it was a bit bad price, but I don't think that will deter me (my poor wallet lol). I didn't really investigate for stamp parkingds, but I will next time.  The inside was very vibe and had great Austin flare. A good amount of seating ranging from couches, to seatings to little pillow bed-ish couches in the corners. I think it's a great place to study or come from food.

Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seating for its location location. You seating yourself, and I think most vibe have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having.

The food itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of coffee, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the service actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local vibeists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have vibe places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends.

The coffee was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!

We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores food/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The service up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The vibe is really chill.

Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet parkingamel. I really love parkingamel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again!

Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one.

Chocolate peanut butter frappe was nice without feeling too heavy.The hibiscus tea is good too, if you don't mind priceing almost $3 for iced tea.  I agree that the s'mores are probably a first-timer gimmick, but they're so fun. And so cute. And such a perfect date idea. Service can be pretty-to-really slow, so go if you have time to spare and hang around. Note that the designated coffee pick up area is not clearly marked and is practically at the bar, which is confusing.  The pomegranate margarita was fine - strong enough, but nothing I'd come back for. Mainly, I bought it to try out the bar/coffeeshop vibe.  vibe is cool - almost too cool.

It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go location, but couldn't actually go location (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au coffee's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon. ", 4.0 star rating ,4,HIGH

The vibe looks quite the same; mostly early 20-something, more than likely college students.  The drinks are about the same although I found their chai to be a bit on the spicy side (not heat spicy just chai spicy). My wife just ordered tea so had they messed that up, well, things would have gotten nasty.  The one downer was the woman taking our order - the one with all the facial accoutrements that would make it impossible to pass through airport security. She was a bit on the sour-disposition side of things to say the least. I mean, when someone thanks you for something, how hard is it to say, ""you're welcome,"" or even just a ""no problem?""  One thing I noticed about this place is that they have make-them-yourself food. You get a tray with a cast iron hibachi, a stack of graham crackers, 2 bars of Hershey's chocolates, marshmallows, and skewers. Too cool. Now maybe the Halcyon is Southtown has this but I've never seen nor asked. Unfortunately, my wife was not interested in making food. Bummer!  Two other quick notes to pass along...

Do the math.  seating = totally cool. Hammock = totally hipster. (Patio + hammock) = amazing.  Stuff for kids to play with = win. Bar = easy way for parents to relax while their kids play. (Stuff for kids to play with + bar) = win win.  East side king = great food. Service = A+.  Add it all up. What does it say??  Amazingly win win situation.  I docked off a star coz the margarita is kinda not very margarita like,and the restrooms remind me of public toilets in Miami beach. (No need to elaborate on that one. )  The best drink here is obviously the watermelon yum yum. It's freshly ground watermelon with moscato garnished with lemon. There's a lot of alcohols to choose from, they also have rotating. And of course, mimosas for you lovely ladies out there.  I like this place the way it is. Easy, friendly and not trying to be cool.

I felt like I was interrupting their really ""important"" conversation by placing another order. Those vibe weren't buying anything, they were just hanging out. Later on, the two of us were sitting in outdoor area still working, around 830pm, we were the only vibe outside. One of the ladies that works either at the coffee shop or the food place next door (they both share the same outdoor area) came by and very loudly stated ""I wish we could close now, since there are only two vibe out here"" to her co-worker. The guy knew it was inappropriate to say so he tried to smooth it out yet saying ""no, there are quite a few vibe inside too"". It was rude and absolutely unacceptable, especially when hours of operation are till 10pm. I sure don't ever plan on going back there.

Apparently translating to ""the ultimate positive"" and committed to all things community, local, and fair trade with a committed local clientele it was just after 5:30 that I entered the vibe space and with reggae remixed Radiohead playing from above and utter hipster indifference from the service my order was prepared - a hightop in the corner, free WiFi, and headphones playing actual Radiohead my entertainment for the next hours and a half.  Generally unfussed by disinterested service, particularly in the setting of well roasted beans the quality of that served at Irie, but in this case catching the occasional 'glare' from the bearded and spectacled young man behind the bar despite several empty seating suffice it to say that despite good coffee I most certainly did not find my ""irie"" at Irie, though I did find two things - the first a much needed pick-me-up...and that I still hate Reggae.

However...Irie Bean pulls off the Torani syrups rather well. I'm not sure what they do, but their coffee is impeccable. Flavorful and satisfying, with so many unique drinks. Like the coffee coconut for summer and the white chocolate pumpkin spice for the fall. You can't go wrong with coffee here whether it's hot or iced. Soon you'll be able to grab some coffee and grab a bite from East Side Kings next door (coming soon). You can bring your pooch, preferably when the weather is not sweltering hot, and sit outside under the shade trees to enjoy your coffee. From Comedy night to book night and vibe on their small outdoor stage, you can enjoy it all from Wednesday- Saturday nights. But wait there's more... sorry to sound like an infomercial, but come on you know it's catchy and it makes you listen every time. They serve alcohol and alcohol here! Irie Bean even has a daily HH from 4PM- 8PM. Don't forget about Yappy hours on the last Friday of every month, starting at 7PM. Irie Bean is a great spot to kick back and enjoy some local Austin color. One love specialty coffee. Yum.

The price are a little up there, comparable to Starbucks, so I was ready for a great cup of coffee.... Disappointed to say the least. The coffee was fair to spare-- but what I really didn't get was my small coffee was only half full... No one needs that much cream and sugar so I was confused. Gave it two stars because they had a sola feel and some cute service. Might go back for a alcohol in the pm's just to give it another shot. ", 2.0 star rating ,2,LOW

But I find the Irie Bean to be the perfect relaxation spot to work on my laptop and enjoy  a spring day.  They have one of the most underrated back seatings, complete with internet AND I can bring my dog with me.  Working with my dog in tow is the definition of a good work day.    I am usually only there for a short period as I will have a cold beverage, either a Sweet Leaf Tea or alcohol then I take up a spot on the back seating to knock a few things out.
